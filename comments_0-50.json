One can get pretty far with that. Even formal verification papers were easy to follow <i>on general idea of their methods or results</i> without know the specialist stuff. Same with digital design. I only started getting slowed down, ineffective, or stomped when it was about analog or RF papers. It&#x27;s why I keep saying one might not be able to cheat those.

Google is doing better here (e.g. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.google.com&#x2F;functions&#x2F;docs&#x2F;emulator\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.google.com&#x2F;functions&#x2F;docs&#x2F;emulator</a> and <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.google.com&#x2F;pubsub&#x2F;docs&#x2F;emulator\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.google.com&#x2F;pubsub&#x2F;docs&#x2F;emulator</a>) As someone who cares greatly about productive developer environments (it&#x27;s a reasonable portion of my day job), I wouldn&#x27;t touch serverless right now.

And welcome to Serverless to those coming from AWS.<p>Here is how Google Cloud achieves serverless.\nIngesting Data: PubSub. Scales to millions of messages instantaneously, no need to spin up and spin down the capacity&#x2F;shards (like as in Kinesis), exposes RESTful interface for ingesting messages from anywhere (web&#x2F;mobile ... ). If you want a high-performance interface, you get gRPC as well. With RESTful interface to consuming messages, you can connect PubSub to anything you want or trigger Cloud Functions &#x2F; write to storage &#x2F; ingest to Stackdriver (Monitoring system) using managed services.<p>Querying Data: Big Query. No need to spin up a single server. Just write your query in SQL and watch the magic of a thousand servers being spun up to serve the query in a fraction of second and process a petabyte of data in a couple of minutes. btw ... you can ingest data into Big Query in real-time and analyze results within in seconds.<p>Process Data using Dataflow: For workflows that are more complex than SQL queries to ones that need to be running continuously on streaming data. Dataflow is the serverless version of Spark. No more running our of memory errors, much fewer hassles with hotkeys, no more manual performance tuning of buffers, no more cleaning up log folders. If you are using Spark, but have not tried Dataflow, you are missing some serious magic.<p>Google Cloud ML for Machine Learning: Cloud ML is a hosted solution for running TensorFlow jobs. No more manual hyperparameter optimization, no more spinning up GPUs, no more scaling up the cluster size. It&#x27;s all taken care for you.<p>Container Engine: Hosted version of Kubernetes. I am sure, everyone is aware of what K8 is and its capabilities.<p>I am from a Data &#x2F; Analytics &#x2F; ML background. The above was my reality of Serverless since 2015.

A reasonable AI system could be trained to do a better job of reading the &#x27;ripe&#x27; signals of fruit and even &#x27;know&#x27; that given fruit since it was just a bud on a flower. Waste could be cut to a minimum if the system was aware of apples ready to go bad or drop to the floor.<p>As well as picking there is also the matter of grading the crop, getting it clean and so on. There is no reason why this machine can&#x27;t do all of that at source, so the apple gets washed, blown spotlessly dry with a Dyson style dryer and then instantly sorted&#x2F;graded and packed into some 100% nitrogen packet of some sort, sent to the distribution centre and on the shelves for lunch the next day.<p>Hopefully our new robotic overlords in the fields will work from above. Instead of heavy tractors, plant and people on the ground you could have some lighter weight equipment strung out from above, a mesh of wires held up by some massive wind turbine towers, to which the fruit picking machines might traverse.<p>McCain Chips are made with robots on the production line that pick out any defects, again, our fruit picking machines could do this and grade any cleaned produce as catering grade, nonetheless prepared clean and packed in nitrogen to prevent any further degradation. A whole new world of better product and time to market might be possible by handing over the fruit picking bit to the robots. Apples could even be picked when they got to a &#x27;perfect size&#x2F;weight&#x27; and not just graded that way, trees could be picked in such a way that all the fruit attains this &#x27;ideal&#x27; which is optimal given inputs.<p>Such a system would work 24&#x2F;7 in all seasons, tending the crop one way or another on a large estate, with some of its robotic arms going places at all times.

Their wages would be higher and spent in the local community rather than sent out of the country.<p>Orchards need not be so regimented for machines in this brave new world, orchards could have a mix of trees of all shapes and sizes, with different land use below, open to people and a proper &#x27;forest floor&#x27; for small furry animals.

Some facts about them:<p>- They are not required to learn German, so they speak very little to sometimes none at all.\n- They can only pick companies where speaking only English is tolerated.\n- Since they speak English, they tend to stick to themselves and cannot integrate. Some of them have a hard time even ordering food.\n- Indian Bachelor degrees are not comparable to German degrees. I have the feeling that there are some good universities, but others are nowhere near the German standard. Their skill levels are usually lower than these of their German counterparts. It makes sense: I have talked to people, who came from a small village and used a computer in their undergraduate course for the first time.\n- When you talk about their plans, it becomes clear, that they aimed for the US or the UK and took Germany only for the price and are often not planning to stay, but to take the next opportunity to board a plane to the US.<p>At the moment I do not think it makes any economical sense for Germany. I would do the following:<p>- mandatory German language courses\n- mandatory German language knowledge, even for English speaking courses\n- much stricter admission standards, individual tests instead of trusting non-EU standards\n- better integration with the labor market\n- maximum to the number of months you can stay in a dorm (already the case for German students)\n- initiatives to form German + foreign flat shares (primary way of living for students in Germany)<p>At the moment we are just sending the bad students back home and the good students to the US, after they got a free education here.<p>The local university close by reacted and increased the required GRE test scores to Ivy League level.

With a degree at a Hauptschule you can only begin an apprenticeship at some jobs, with a degree on a Realschule an apprenticeship in all jobs and with a Gymnasium degree (Abitur) you are allowed to study at a university or Fachhochschule (&quot;Fachhochschule&quot; is often translated with &quot;school of applied science&quot;, but I think there is no real translation, since this is a very German concept: You study some applied subject (traditionally engineering) there with little focus on research question, but it is a lot more school-like than universities (few elective subjects, &quot;more like sitting in a classroom&quot;).<p>This basic three-tiered system has now been convoluted (for example often &quot;Hauptschule&quot; and &quot;Realschule&quot; are often combined into a &quot;Sekundarschule&quot; (translating this with &quot;secondary school&quot; is in my opinion a false friend) or there also exist comprehensive schools that encompass all three tiers, but I think you get the basic idea.<p>To what kind of secondary school you may go is decided on the marks in the 4th class.<p>Now to your question: If your marks are too bad, you have to repeat a year (which reflects badly in your CV!) or (also not untypical) are &quot;advised&quot; to switch to a &quot;lower tier&quot; school. Details for these rules change all the time, but I would consider it as typical that at most one 5 (second worst mark) is allowed in a primary subject and at most two 5s are allowed in all subjects for passing. Also no 6 (worst mark) is allowed for passing.<p>Also it is often very typical that at a Gymnasium that you have to have good marks to be allowed to attend the Oberstufe (11th to 12th or 13th year) - otherwise you only get a &quot;Realschulabschluss&#x2F;erweiterter Sekundarschulabschluss&quot; (two different names for mostly the same concept).","time":1493556913,"type":"comment"},{"by":"patall","id":14231053,"kids":[{"by":"lispm","id":14232182,"parent":14231053,"text":"&gt; The current generation has an university enrollment rate of about 50%.<p>Enrollment does not mean that they get a degree.

It&#x27;s like a cross between high school, juvenile hall, and the DMV.<p>For example, a lot of the students at community colleges are stoners who are only there because their parents have conditioned their financial support on college attendance, and those are the people who you will have to compete with for enrollment in impacted classes, and who will drag down your grade on group projects. The labs, libraries, and other facilities are pretty much a joke compared to what you get to use at a good UC or CSU, or even a good public high school. You are unlikely to develop personal connections that will help you build your career.<p>On top of all of that, transferring is not as easy at it might seem. You have to watch the transfer office like a hawk to make sure they don&#x27;t screw up your paperwork. I had a guaranteed admission agreement, and even so, I caught multiple mistakes and miscommunications between the community college and the UC which would have voided my agreement, or delayed my transfer for a year. De Anza has one of the highest transfer rates in the country, so I can only assume things are even worse at other schools.<p>While you are trying to push your way through two years (at least) in this depressing and dysfunctional environment, your friends at CSUs and UCs will be enjoying higher quality classmates, instructors, and facilities, living the real college life, getting cool internships and other career opportunities, and making personal connections with people who will be successful in their fields.<p>In the end, the amount of money I saved by going to community college and transferring to a UC, compared to going to a UC for four years, adds up to the cost of a new Toyota Camry. That&#x27;s a trivial amount of money, now that I look back on it years later -- a couple hundred dollars a month in student loans over a standard repayment term.

My background is I studied engineering in the UK where I live, but grew up and lived in the Germanic world. I have a brother and several friends and relatives who studied in the US, and friends who are German graduates. So maybe I can Frankenstein some advice for you.<p>- In the US, you study a broad range of subjects at undergrad. So my bro had to do literature classes and such, even though he really just wanted to mess with computers. My UK and Germanic (Scandinavian&#x2F;German&#x2F;Swiss) friends went straight from high school directly into Engineering and only Engineering courses. Advice for doctors: save time this way. You&#x27;ll be cutting up carcasses your first week of uni. I&#x27;ve met doctors in their early 20s and nurses in their teens.<p>- &quot;Being a student&quot; is different in Europe, and it&#x27;s different between the UK and the continent. In the US, there&#x27;s a 4-year ideal. You go, you study for 4 years, you&#x27;re done. Not everyone manages this, but the top end at least is very much aimed at you being able to do that with your life. In Germanic countries it&#x27;s relatively normal to take time out, even have a baby. Plenty of people take 7 years to do a 5 year course. Many friends of mine have done this. You get stressed, you take a semester out. You have a death in the family, you take time out. You generally find that people try to balance studying with life. This also means you&#x27;ll find older people at university. 27 year olds are common.<p>- The UK is similar to the US in this respect. Almost everyone I know did their UK courses in one stretch, in the allotted 3 or 4 years.<p>- Many European universities have no campus as such. They&#x27;re just spread out around the town. A small town like Cambridge is maybe the closest you get to a campus university, but it&#x27;s still got town in it. Oxford is also a bit hard to classify, being in a medium sized town but with the colleges all in one section, with independent businesses and shops thrown in. But being out in town might have a big effect on your social life, so think about it.<p>- Getting into college is more straightforward in Europe than the US. They look at your grades, and only a little at your work&#x2F;life experience (secondary ways to get in). In many countries there&#x27;s a GPA you need that&#x27;s published each year per course. Assuming you did the right mix of high school courses, you can look up what you could have gotten into.<p>- In the UK it was just a couple of pages when I did it; a list of your predicted grades, and a half page recommendation from a teacher. For Oxbridge it&#x27;s then a couple of 30 minute interviews, and an offer letter saying what they need you to actually get on the exams. But you&#x27;re not going to miss the place if they send you an offer. And you can do 6 applications on the same form.<p>- Very little special treatment in the European systems. Not a lot of stories of rich kids getting into Oxford because their dad built a library. The most you get is the boat race guys who study something odd sounding, but these days a lot of them study a real subject and do the real homework while training like nutters.<p>- In the US, it&#x27;s monstrous. First there&#x27;s legacy and donation people, and sports scholarships. Those are not open to most mortal folk, and I have zero idea how exactly you wrangle a place that way. So then there&#x27;s filling out a large form, which costs money. There&#x27;s SATs which you need, more money, more time. Then you gotta find a bunch of teachers who will write that you&#x27;re a genius. And then you gotta demonstrate that in an amazing essay. And repeat for each university. I ended up not applying in the US when I got my offer letter in mid December.<p>- Many, many courses are in English despite being in the Germanic world. They don&#x27;t like to admit it, but their languages are slowly being invaded by English. Also they understand you need English in modern academia. A fair few higher level science courses will be in English entirely. All the young people will speak English, many of them well enough to write academic papers. Anglo culture is everywhere, people will have watched your TV series and they know your music. Even to the point where several of the top acts in those countries are known for songs sung in English.<p>- Are the degrees accredited? This is an interesting question. In the UK and US I&#x27;ve never heard of anyone being asked to prove they had some degree. The facility does exist to ask your uni of course, it&#x27;s just I&#x27;ve never heard of anyone being asked to see their diploma. Now it might matter if you&#x27;re going to use the degree to get a further degree, but from what I&#x27;ve seen plenty of Europeans show up at Oxford to do a masters or DPhil, no problem. Other way round probably mostly works too.<p>- The only place I&#x27;ve ever been asked to show my diploma was in Switzerland.

I was a foreign student who did studienkolleg (preparatory university course), bachelor and master degrees in German in Bavaria. In total, I spent 6 years in their educational system.<p>One thing to highlight is that German universities are very different to the American system of small groups, interaction with students, labs, hand-holding, etc. Traditional German education is one where you are not obliged to go to classes and you only have one final exam at the end of the semester. Some classes had up to 800 students. In other classes, we never got to see the professor and we were taught by a PhD student. Nobody knew your name and you were just another face, if you ever showed up to class. Thus, the marginal cost of having an additional local or foreign student is minimum.<p>This system is not for everyone and given that my classes were all in German, it was very challenging. University-level German (vocabulary, idioms, etc) is very different from the one you learn at the Sprachkurs. Most foreign students dropped out and went back home. This is also accentuated by the fact that if you fail an exam 3 times, you are expelled from the university and you are banned from studying that study field for life across all German universities.<p>Moreover, German universities do not have their own sport facilities and luxurious campuses as their American counterparts. Normally, for sports, there is a shared facility for all local universities and you pay an extra semester ticket to have access. The average German university has old facilities and no luxuries. Thus, the cost base is completely different to universities in the US.<p>Back then, we were told that Germany offers education to foreigners to foster relations with foreign countries. If we foreigners study in Germany and are shaped the German way, once we go home, not only we will be well qualified, but also we will be keen to establish business relations with German companies.<p>During my study times, around 2006, they introduced at my university fees for everyone. The idea was not popular and it was not covering the cost of education. The idea did not last long. Some years later it went back to be free for everyone. German universities are very left-leaning and in the German society there is a wide consensus that university education should be free for all.<p>The CDU and FDP, two political parties on the right spectrum, constantly push the idea of charging foreign students to help finance public education, but the idea has never gotten any type of support in the society.","time":1493554854,"type":"comment"},{"by":"bisRepetita","id":14231402,"parent":14225822,"text":"One argument, not made, is that it may help German students too.

I have friends in Norway I&#x27;ve known over decades who still don&#x27;t speak a word of Norwegian.<p>For an english speaker dutch is probably easier to learn than German, as dutch is closer to english.

Not sure about Norwegian, but it is probably an easier language than German. Not quite as complicated grammar.<p>Having studied at very different universities with respect to ranking, I got to say I don&#x27;t think ranking means very much for the average student. It is overhyped, I can&#x27;t see a huge difference. Ultimately results are going to depend on you and your efforts.<p>In fact there has been studies of this. Ivy League universities don&#x27;t actually improve your grades or earning prospects. It just looks like that due to creaming. But when they compare SAT scores of students who could get into an Ivy League but chose not to with those who did, one doesn&#x27;t see a difference in salary afterwards: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usnews.com&#x2F;education&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;the-college-solution&#x2F;2011&#x2F;03&#x2F;01&#x2F;the-ivy-league-earnings-myth\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usnews.com&#x2F;education&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;the-college-solution&#x2F;...</a><p>I read in another study that if you are at the lower tier in an ivy league you will actually end up worse, because it will kill your confidence to be around so many people smarter than you. Go to a normal college where you are among the better and it will boost your confidence and ability to excel.<p>And many might already have read that Google does in fact not favor ivy league students as they are typically to dependent on external drive, grades etc, rather than internal drive to make good products which is what matters at google.<p>Anyway I think people should focus more on going a place they would enjoy. I think many European universities are very nice to attend because in Europe there are lots of cities which are easy to walk and with great public transport. That makes life a lot nicer for students. You can easily get around town and do all sorts of stuff, either, with bike, walking, tram, bus etc. Also at least in northern Europe societies tend to offer more freedom for youngsters. I&#x27;ve studied in the US for a year and found it too restrictive. There is too much control on young people. You can&#x27;t drink until 21. Dormitories have a lot of rules and are gender segregated. In e.g. Norway or the Netherlands, student housing means sharing a real apartment with people.

The compiler (semantic analysis + codegen) didn&#x27;t support much of the language though, e.g. it doesn&#x27;t know how to code-gen for &gt; but it knows &lt;.

The few who persisted habitually wrote messages like, &quot;...feature cannot be done due to a limitation in the OS&quot;<p>4. Speed - if Bill was in charge, WP would be hale &amp; hearty right now. Ballmer and his people took their sweet time before adding new features - as if they were competing with resourceless startups or stagnant giants. Thousands of feature requests flooded Nokia forum, the ln user voice - only for a handful to be added a year and six months later. E.g.

Hell, I sometimes even play drinking games (e.g. sociables) with a glass of water.

It&#x27;s a horribly inefficient way to use my time.<p>Also it&#x27;s really, really easy to use here in Canada where they make you log into your ebank with your credentials -- horrible security? well, that&#x27;s what sofort does too -- and that&#x27;s it.

The Seikan tunnel to Hokkaido had huge variations in soil and the project went very slowly. Eurotunnel is mostly through chalk, and went well.  The Gotthard Base Tunnel in Switzerland was a long grind through hard rock well above water level.  That&#x27;s a slow process, but was reasonably uniform. SF&#x27;s BART tunnel, unusually, was built onshore in sections and lowered into a dredged trench. NYC&#x27;s Water Tunnel #3 was in hard rock, and that project went very slowly.<p>Many things can go wrong. Hard rock may not be competent rock capable of supporting itself.  The Tom Lantos tunnels south of San Francisco were through a small mountain of loose shale. One tunneling project in Japan hit an underground river.<p>The most advanced underground rail project today is probably the Tokyo-Osaka maglev line.[2] 43 kilometers of this is already operating, and most of the route is in tunnel.

Unfortunately TBM&#x27;s are no longer early stage, but for some reason the technology is frozen at just-good-enough-to-barely-work.&quot;<p>However I don&#x27;t know if the economics will work out to fix any of these. Here are a couple of the big problems:<p>* Most TBM&#x27;s are semi- or fully-customized for a single job. This raises machine costs. It&#x27;d be better if there were only a small range of small-medium-large TBM&#x27;s that work ~everywhere.<p>* Most TBM&#x27;s are fully assembled in the factory, smoketested aka turned on to make sure they work, disassembled and shipped to the job, then reassembled and used. This is not efficient, surely we can figure out a better way.<p>* Most TBM&#x27;s are entombed aka thrown away at the end of the job, because getting them out of the hole is expensive and difficult.<p>* Changing the cutterheads is labor intensive and dangerous and requires highly trained very expensive humans, and it&#x27;s slow. While you change the cutterheads, your billion dollar toy is sitting there doing nothing.<p>* TBM architecture is highly dependent on geology. A slurry faced TBM that works in mixed soils is a totally different beast from a hard-rock TBM. It would be cool to have one machine that works in many geologies, perhaps with minimal or automated modifications.<p>* TBM&#x27;s require lots of care and feeding from a small army of humans. This raises job costs.<p>* Topside support infrastructure such as slurry plants and ground freezing machinery comes from different vendors, often even from different countries. E.g. it&#x27;s common to buy your topside slurry plant from the MS company, in France, while your ground freeze vendor might be Tachibana from Japan. Often each subsystem&#x27;s engineers on site literally don&#x27;t even speak a common language. Hilarity predictably ensues. Vertical integration would pay huge dividends here.<p>Ideally Elon can mass-produce TBM&#x27;s that just work out of the box for most jobs, and that are easier to work on.

The average car would weight less than a bus, and could travel at very high speeds.<p>Existing trains and subway systems are based off of hundred-year old freight train systems which were designed to transport thousands of tons of weight. This has a huge cost for subway and commuter train design.  A modern subway train costs millions of dollars, weighs multiple tons, and is an immense engineering task.<p>By engineering a total target track and car weight of a few tons per spacing instead - this system would be far cheaper and easier to maintain.<p>Passenger cars would be designed to hold only a dozen people, and cars would be linked or unlinked as needed to increase capacity and efficiency.  This design also allows the system to maintain extra cars of varying sizes to manage variable rider capacity.  Rather than time tables, the system would run based on rider demand, maintaining a slight over-capacity to handle peaks.  This is no different than the typical Uber-type demand based system.<p>On the typical street, such systems would only utilize a few square feet of space per block.

He has made public comments (especially around the time when he open-sourced his patents) that support both (A) and (B) being true.

So for the vast majority of code, it wouldn&#x27;t matter.  Correction: <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> matter.  For example, Apple&#x27;s Swift language produces code that is incredibly slow when non-optimized, loops and the like can easily be 1000x (a thousand times!) slower than optimized, and yet Xcode&#x27;s debug builds default to non-optimized and people don&#x27;t report that their debug builds are unusable.<p>Another example:  I implemented the central re-pagination loop in my BookLightning imposition app[2] in my Objective-Smalltalk language[3], which currently has just about the slowest implementation imaginable (an AST-walker inefficiently implemented in Objective-C), at least an order of magnitude slower than Ruby.  Despite that, BookLightning is at least an order of magnitude faster than the OS-X print system, which is largely written in C. Why?  It computes by page (which is sufficient for this task), rather than by individual PDF graphical element. That difference is so great that the steering code controlling the computation just doesn&#x27;t matter.<p>&gt; Surely then you&#x27;d start to get frustrated with the overhead?<p>As long as Objective-C were still a hybrid language: probably not, because I could always eliminate the overhead in the (very) few places that mattered, and could do so reliably&#x2F;predictably [4].

It&#x27;s interesting that you use the phrase &#x27;good-faith political discussions&#x27; here, because that has significant ramifications for judging what we find repugnant.<p>Let&#x27;s suppose for a moment that I really can&#x27;t stand people in the XYZ group. Under the doctrine of free speech, I might write all kinds of things to promulgate my opinions, from asserting that the XYZs are boring and stupid, to opining that XYZ people are going to hell, and so on.<p>But what if I say that XYZ people shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to post on the internet? Well now I&#x27;m not upholding free speech any more, in fact I&#x27;d be asserting an intention to deny it to one group of whom I don&#x27;t approve. Am I really discussing my views in good faith in that case? What if I say they should be killed? OK that doesn&#x27;t go directly to free speech, but since it&#x27;s impossible for people express themselves freely if they&#x27;re not alive I&#x27;m certainly limiting their free speech indirectly.<p>What I&#x27;m arguing here is that there&#x27;s a qualitative difference between my saying &#x27;I think you are bad (in some way) and I dislike you&#x27; and calling for people to have their rights curtailed because they occupy a category that I find repugnant. In the first case I&#x27;m expressing my emotional hostility, but in the second case I&#x27;m making a positive proposal that their freedoms should be reduced relative to mine.<p>I&#x27;m quite opposed to fascism and similar authoritarian ideologies, and lately I keep running into people who raise this free speech argument, and ask if I am not being worse than the fascists myself for arguing that their views should be driven out of mainstream discourse and marginalized or shut down as efficiently as possible.<p>But to mind mind, people who espouse such authoritarian ideologies are <i>not</i> arguing in good faith. They&#x27;re not saying things like &#x27;it&#x27;s so bad that [this group] won&#x27;t sign onto my ideology, oh well live and let live.&#x27; They&#x27;re saying things like &#x27;[this group] is morally&#x2F; culturally&#x2F; physically deficient and should not be allowed to participate in society, or maybe even in life.&#x27;<p>To put it in a single sentence, I do not feel inclined inclined to defend the liberty interests of those who have expressed an intention to do harm to me - not necessarily me personally, but because of my membership in various social categories of which they disapprove. To use historical examples, it&#x27;s not like if some Jews went to Nazi rallies thy were welcomed with open arms as converts to some new intellectual current; their Jewishness (or membership in some other &#x27;degenerate&#x27; category) made them <i>ineligible to participate</i> in the Nazi project.<p>I fail to see how you can justify giving free speech protections to those who make no secret of their desire to limit other people&#x27;s liberties. I don&#x27;t hate Richard Spencer because he&#x27;s white, male, and has a particular haircut, I hate the fact that he&#x27;s actively exhorting people to join him in a project get rid of people who are not white enough.<p>I&#x27;m a-OK with people punching Richard Spencer precisely because he has dedicated himself for the last several years to promoting a narrow and aggressive policy of racial supremacy that includes reducing the liberty of others by killing them or driving them out of their homes. If he were to popup in public tomorrow and announce that he&#x27;d renounced fascism and that people should be judged on the quality of their behavior towards others then I would no longer support people punching him as randomly and as often as possible. But while he&#x27;s advocating systemic violence against others, he is not to my mind arguing in good faith because he is not willing to uphold that free speech principle for everyone else.<p>The other argument I hear from some people is &#x27;well the solution to hate speech is more speech.&#x27; That&#x27;s bullshit spoken by people who don&#x27;t actually know what it&#x27;s like to feel that their safety is at risk. Obviously I don&#x27;t reach to interfere with someone&#x27;s free speech every time I hear something I dislike - a person might be crazy or just angry and offensive by announcing the fact of their prejudice or suchlike, and in most cases they&#x27;re best refuted, mocked, or ignored.<p>but where someone is knowingly and systematically arguing [out-group] are inherently terrible <i>people</i> - not the same thing as saying that people in [group] have inherently terrible <i>ideas</i> - then I&#x27;m not willing to guard a place on the platform for those who are using that position to push others off the platform.

Everyone should be concerned that real political speech is being suppressed, even if it&#x27;s not happening to their side. Instead, people are actively encouraging it.<p>Because we no longer hold most of our political discourse in physical rooms where it&#x27;s much harder to simply dismiss or ignore someone who is also present, and because we no longer have to go across an open area where anyone is able to distribute their content or peddle their ideas, the internet is contributing to the rise of a generation that has <i>no idea</i> how to disagree civilly.<p>&gt;Even the idea that &#x27;you can&#x27;t bypass the public square&#x27; is simply not true, neither physically nor philosphically.

One person&#x27;s freedom to speak must be balanced with another person&#x27;s freedom to exclude that speech from their private life. Private folks having the ability to go places where they can ignore the people they&#x27;ve chosen to ignore is an important part of why free speech works at all. For instance, we don&#x27;t need laws against Holocaust deniers, we can simply choose to frequent places where they are excluded.<p>Freedom of speech as a <i>law</i> is the release valve for this tension. If every private individual and organization in the country has chosen to ignore a person&#x27;s views, that person is still free to make themselves heard with the government. They can write letters and go to meetings with no fear of punishment for the unpopularity of their beliefs. They can&#x27;t be legally kept from starting their own private organization where they are not ignored and advertising it to attract others.<p>Personally, I just find this all to be a very good solution to a difficult problem, so I&#x27;m skeptical when I see suggestions that it should be done differently. In this case, the suggestion is that the freedom to exclude (as a principle - there is no law in this direction) should be more tightly regulated. Maybe that&#x27;s a good idea because of the unique circumstances of the internet, but I&#x27;m not yet convinced that it&#x27;s better than the current regime, which has existed for a long time, and which I think works pretty well.","time":1493484853,"type":"comment"},{"by":"jerheinze","id":14225681,"kids":[{"by":"ykler","id":14225785,"kids":[{"by":"timthelion","id":14225830,"kids":[{"by":"lottin","id":14226474,"parent":14225830,"text":"The UK, France, Spain and possibly others have laws against &quot;glorifying terrorism&quot;.

Anecdotally, I participated pretty heavily in the first couple weeks of the Occupy Wall Street protests in Manhattan.  For the first week or so, we got very little news coverage, and a lot of the established media was downplaying the movement, waiting for it to blow over, or picking the craziest people they could find out of the crowd to discredit us.  Russia Today was one of the few news organizations who came out early, giving us positive coverage, and reflecting the views of the protesters more or less accurately.  A lot of my friends became RT viewers because RT legitimately succeeded where the domestic media failed.<p>RT has played the strategy of going in and eating the domestic media&#x27;s lunch when they hesitate to cover legitimate stories, and that has given them a dedicated following.  Unfortunately, as time has passed, it has grown more clear (at least to me) that this bona-fide coverage is the bait they pull people in with, and that their coverage in general is of the journalistic quality of Fox News.  They use the same tactics of lying through omission, stoking panic, appealing to emotion, and selecting stories to promote an agenda.<p>As for the social media shilling, the situation is extremely nuanced.  At this point there are probably tens of thousands of organizations astroturfing social media to promote their interests.  Russia gets a lot of attention, because they seem to be doing it on the largest scale in terms of influencing geopolitics, but I agree that they aren&#x27;t the only ones doing it, and that if we make them stop, the problem won&#x27;t go away.  The media has spoken up a lot about Russia&#x27;s twitter&#x2F;facebook botting and shilling, but if we were to take a much closer look at the data, I wouldn&#x27;t be the least bit surprised to see some shady domestic political think tanks and action committees doing it to the same extent.  In fact, the shadowy domestic PACs engaging in astroturfing are probably ecstatic that Russia has taken the focus (and blame) off of them!   The Internet has become a ideological battleground, and at this point, anybody who has any power to gain&#x2F;lose has rolled up their sleeves and entered into the fray.

Let&#x27;s not forget that Bush&#x27;s grandfather was also funding Nazi [2] (I would like to focus primarily on the years before Americans joined WW2, basically, before they &quot;knew&quot; that Nazis were not yet official enemies) and he earned a lot of money out of it.<p>Nowadays, a lot of companies do the same. And it will always be like this, unless such a country is recognized as an official &quot;enemy&quot; of the state, and you can&#x27;t do business there.<p>So, we have already 1 reason that you simply can&#x27;t stop communicating from the top.<p>Then, you have one more reason: immigrants.<p>Europe has a bunch of Turkish people which, it seems, helped a lot during the elections - in some cases (Holland, Austria, and Germany) the &quot;YES&quot; to the referendum got more than 60% (in some cases 68%). This opens up a whole new bunch of questions we should ask ourselves (and people actually do, at least in Europe):<p>- Why?<p>- Why did these people vote for YES?<p>- Don&#x27;t these people value the freedom they have here (which they <i>do</i> have, unlike in the US - sorry guys, that&#x27;s how we perceive it in Europe - where racism is much more common)?<p>Questions which raise another question:<p>- What did we <i>as Europe</i> (or West?) do wrong?<p>This is somehow connected to your sentence:<p>&gt; We should try to get real people to talk, about who they are, what they want (peace ? surely .. war ? not so sure). So peoples in every nation start to avoid the national&#x2F;patriot filter when thinking and voting.<p>In my opinion there are too many things we did wrong and failed to do.<p>One thing is to have expectations. In Europe, I can tell you that before the Turkish referendum there were a lot of people, mostly reporters and journalists, going out asking such &quot;pro-YES&quot; voters (they were grouping together for propaganda or for any other reason) whether they actually were aware of what Erdogan wanted to achieve with this referendum. Obviously, <i>nobody</i> actually knew all the points in it. The journalist was mentioning each point, and their faces were like &quot;uh?&quot;, while, of course, some of them were bitten by the strong cognitive dissonance: &quot;no, but this is what media here say...&quot;, or &quot;no, but it&#x27;s not as bad as it seems&quot;.<p>This issue dates back to the beginning of immigration. People with low education came, and many of them simply didn&#x27;t get further - meaning, 2nd, 3rd generations still striving to make it, or criminals, or simply living off of social money. Where can this lead to? Entire neighborhoods not accessible to the police, criminality rate super high, etc. People who cannot even talk the national language - forced, therefore, to watch their own news.<p>Another issue: double citizenship. What is that? You live here, but you still have a voice in your country. Sorry, but no. After X years, as an immigrant you get citizenship from the country you live&#x2F;pay taxes in. Further, you are born in this country, eventually (in some countries when you are 18) you get this country&#x27;s citizenship. That&#x27;s it. Either that, or the old one. Both? No.<p>There is a sentence from a German author, Max Frisch, &quot;We wanted a labour force, but human beings came&quot; [3], which kind of explains what had really happened. And now? That&#x27;s what we have. A huge mess, people creating parallel societies, and Erdogan that comes to Europe as a good politician to the majority of his people.<p>Why good politician?

Social plankton is every group your device ever connects to- and is constituted by those members of the group, which who can gather the most &quot;Yes&quot;-votes about theire prediction, of the behaviour of the group.\nTake a bus filled with people driving to work. They always constitute from slightly diffrent devices, but the time is always the same, the amount of devices is always the same- and there is always that one deciding device - belonging to the social plankton &quot;transportation-company&quot; without the plankton would never come together.<p>Now lets take the greatest possible counter example: A convention of bus drivers, riding on a bus to the first convention of its kind.\nThey would debate alot, and agree upon it beeing a bus- but neither could secure a majority - which bus it is. None of the driving by social plankton - called houses and cars, is able to identify the bus of busses, thus a new social plankton class is created.<p>How does a adress in this add-hoc net look like?\nIt consists of a Unique identifier, wrapped into layers of social plankton, sorted by likelihood.

I clearly missed a lot of these on my brief skim of the article, and I think I understand where you&#x27;re coming from. I think we can both agree that the article needs work to be more comprehensive and precise&#x2F;accurate. Feel free to read my rebuttals to some of your points below, before I stopped writing them haha. And I&#x27;m sorry for whichever commenter belittled your thoughts, that was pretty rude and not conducive to discussion.<p>&gt;&gt; For starters, while this is a fringe case (~0.3 - 0.6% is a lazy estimated range taken from Wikipedia) it takes up 2&#x2F;5 of the introductory section.<p>I&#x27;m not sure why this is a problem. Like you said, Transgenderism is a &quot;fringe case from normal&quot;, but the article in full mainly covers the abnormal (otherwise it would be a fairly short article). So relative to the other abnormalities, transgenderism ranks fairly high on the list. Not to mention that the rest of that paragraph covers more than just transgenderism, it also covers intersex (as you allude to).<p>&gt;&gt; I&#x27;m of the opinion that gender and sex should be treated very much separately, and this posits that assigning a sex at birth is &quot;potentially problematic&quot; just because the person&#x27;s gender might not match up later in life.<p>Are you using gender in place of &quot;gender identity&quot;? I was under the impression that gender identity was how a person perceives their own gender, which can be an amalgamation of gender identity, social constructs, and biological sex (from my brief scan of the gender wikipedia page). Not to sound crass, but these definitions are confusing to me even after multiple lectures on the topic.<p>Additionally, I think that&#x27;s it&#x27;s fairly well documented that a mismatch between someone&#x27;s gender identity and assigned sex can be &quot;problematic&quot;, with respect to mental health problems.<p>&gt;&gt; That&#x27;s well and good, but this is only relevant for intersex people, and this seems to imply that it is also so for transgender children.<p>You&#x27;re right that it is only relevant for intersex people. All of the sources cited are regarding intersexuality, not transgenderism. The previous sentence is also about intersex children, so it makes sense that the following statement would follow with that. Could it be more clear? Absolutely, and maybe I&#x27;ll submit an edit to the page right now to clarify that.<p>&gt;&gt; has resulted in the thinking that it is a child&#x27;s right to determine their sex<p>This is almost universally frowned upon by medical professionals. DSM-V lays out very clear criteria for what to do in these scenarios. After age 1-2, wait until after the age of 18 for gender reassignment.<p>&gt;&gt; Again, over half of this section [Terminology] is dominated by transgenderism-related text.<p>No it isn&#x27;t. It makes up maybe 20% of the section at the most. And refer to my previous point about how it&#x27;s definitely relevant to the article, relative to the percentage of &quot;abnormal&quot; sex assignment dominated by transgenderism.<p>&gt;&gt; To me this idea seems to imply that sex is something that is arbitrarily chosen by a Doctor at birth<p>Didn&#x27;t the explanation of how sex assignment works get discussed in the very beginning of the article, in the introduction? To quote, &quot;In the majority of births, a relative, midwife, nurse or physician inspects the genitalia when the baby is delivered...&quot; . That seems pretty biological to me, looking at their genitalia and thereby means of procreation.<p>&gt;&gt; I consider gender to be a set of social protocols...<p>You&#x27;re right, and I don&#x27;t know why they specifically say &quot;physically change&quot; in the article, as they clearly meant physically AND mentally. I don&#x27;t think that psychological methods can be &quot;physical&quot;. This is more of a commentary on needing to edit the page, which I may again try to clarify in a few minutes after posting this. Again, the terms confuse me at times, so I&#x27;m trying to recall if there is such a thing as &quot;biological gender&quot; or not, and if the author of that particular part of the article could have been referring to.","time":1493746733,"type":"comment"}],"parent":14226593,"text":"Sure, I&#x27;ll elaborate:<p>&gt;&gt; In some cases, sex or gender assignment does not align with future gender identity, and the assignment can be problematic.<p>For starters, while this is a fringe case (~0.3 - 0.6% is a lazy estimated range taken from Wikipedia) it takes up 2&#x2F;5 of the introductory section.<p>Sex assignment not matching future gender identity &quot;can be problematic&quot;.

Intersex occurs significantly less than transgenderism, at around 0.06% of the population.<p>This kind of thinking can and has resulted in the thinking that it is a child&#x27;s right to determine their sex; see for instance the gender reassignment clinics in Canada that treat children as young as 4 years old. I find it very hard to envision a reasonable country where a child of 4 is given the choice to undergo intensive surgery which will also render them infertile.<p>It&#x27;s already forbidden for Canadian schools to tell parents if their children are identifying as the opposite gender at school; I suspect the next step will be placing children out of their homes if their parents refuse to let them transition. A brave new world.<p>To add insult to injury, child gender reassignment surgery and the usage of puberty blockers are still highly experimental. A few things are known (like the decreased bone density) but many important questions remain unanswered, like the impact on brain development. It will be a long time before this is solved because there just aren&#x27;t a lot of children undergoing sex reassignment surgeries, thank god.<p>&gt;&gt; Terminology<p>This section goes to great lengths to only use &quot;Male&quot; and &quot;Female&quot; in the context of &quot;Assigned X at birth&quot;. In fact, the whole article contains not one mention of the names of the two sexes, except when narrating about people who do not &quot;fit typical notions of male and female bodies&quot;, the one in &quot;Terminology&quot;. Again, over half of this section is dominated by transgenderism-related text.<p>&gt;&gt; Assigned X at birth<p>To me this idea seems to imply that sex is something that is arbitrarily chosen by a Doctor at birth; the Doctor here being portrayed as the personification of &quot;the Patriarchy&quot;.

I don&#x27;t agree that gender is a physical thing at all. I consider gender to be a set of social protocols that generally ease interactions between individuals, by providing a default set of roles a person of either gender can build their identity off, and while also easing day-to-day interactions between the sexes by defining common protocols.<p>&quot;putatively erroneous sex assignment at birth&quot; implies that gender dysphoria is more real than a person&#x27;s sex, ignoring the fact that a person&#x27;s sex does not change with &quot;sexual reassignment surgery&quot; as a person&#x27;s chromosomes don&#x27;t change and that person will never have the same sexual function as a person of the sex whose visual characteristics they imitate with surgery.<p>Neither this section or the rest of this article acknowledges that sex is in any way grounded in biological reality. There is a much better Wikipedia article on &quot;Sex determination systems&quot;, but none of the information there is mentioned in the &quot;Sex assignment&quot; article.

There are algorithms that can do what you call &quot;manual reconstruction&quot; in a more or less automated way. Of course, as with everything that is automated, there are edge cases where it doesn&#x27;t work correctly, but it&#x27;ll save you a lot of time.<p>What has been discussed here and in the OC, is mostly header-footer carving, but file-structure-based carving has been around for a long time already (I think Foremost included it in 2005&#x2F;2006, and PhotoRec supports it for <i>some</i> formats). Using the file command (*NIX) or TRiD to find the headers is a bit of a hack, and useful only if you want to sit a long time with dd (or an equivalent tool) and direct yourself the carving process.<p>As for the fragmentation issue, there used to be around a great program called &quot;Adroit Photo Forensic&quot; which implemented the amazing SmartCarving(TM) approach (academically known as graph-theoretic-carving) in which the disk is scanned, pools of segments by file format are populated, and then a graph is constructed and analyzed with a Dijkstra&#x27;s shortest-path variant which works on multiple paths from multiple starts-to-ends. Very interesting, though a bit computationally expensive. Plus you need an extremely precise similarity metric between the segments, which was actually the weak-spot for this. However, it seems as if the Adroit product has died (I can only find mirrors now which host old versions of it), and as it was a try-and-buy program I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;d be able to use it now.<p>Thing is, there are easier ways to handle fragmentation. For example, PhotoRec itself lets you pass an agressive validation step, to discard most of the &quot;probably wrong&quot; recovered files, and then dump the remaining to an alternative disk image, on which you can try carving again. Of course, this iterative process takes time, but it can work, and of course it can be automated (and thus, saving you from manual intervention).<p>While my work has taken me away from it, I never quite understood why the digital forensics community &quot;forgot&quot; about file carving, or disregarded it as an important problem -- it seems as if there are still the same issues around as when I worked on it, while having less tools available.<p>As for the SeqBox format, more than an alternative to this tools, I find it as an interesting complement to them.","time":1493563282,"type":"comment"}],"parent":14230159,"text":"I would say rather common.<p>The whole issue is that file carving (once filesystem structures are destroyed) works fine with contiguous data but it doesn&#x27;t work (or it works only very partially, and depending on a number of factors) with any fragmented data.<p>But I will give you a common enough example, that I have seen happen many times.<p>The user wants to format a USB stick, but by mistake he&#x2F;she selects a data volume instead.<p>Two possibilities (under Windows later than XP):<p>1) user chose NOT the &quot;&#x2F;q&quot; (cli) or &quot;quick&quot; (GUI) format, all data is lost forever as starting from Vista if a &quot;full&quot; format is cosen the whole volume will be overwritten with 00&#x27;s<p>2) user chose to &quot;quick&quot; format, only the filesystem structures are recreated (blank) and - given that the volume was originally formatted on the same OS - they will be exactly where previous filesystem structure were, thus cleanly replacing them.<p>In this latter situation all files are still there, what is lost is where they are, the address info for a contiguous file is two pieces of data, where it begins and how big in size it is, there are a number of programs that can &quot;recognize&quot; a file (or its beginning) by its &quot;signature&quot; (usually a header, but sometimes a combination of header and footer), among them the excellent TriD tool by the same Author Marco Pontello, and a large number of file formats do include some info on the filesize, and there are slightly more sophisticated programs that can usually recognize if data belongs to a given filetype.<p>The address info of a fragmented data is as many starting points and as many extensions as the fragments, and since a fragment - bar the first one - have no headers it is extremely difficult to find all the fragments of a file (and knowing to which file a fragment belongs) and re-build the file by re-assembling the fragments in the right order, often impossible.<p>In a nutshell, if the volume was only made of contiguous files, they can be recovered 100% or very near 100%, only losing their filenames and their path in the &quot;previous&quot; filesystem structure.<p>BUT any file that was fragmented will either be lost completely or will need (in some cases only this is possible) manual reconstruction, something that may take days or weeks of work and very often with only very scarce or partial success.<p>The idea of a &quot;self-referencing&quot; archive with sector-level granularity is simply great, you won&#x27;t ever <i>need</i> it, but if you do, it could be a lifesaver.","time":1493544343,"type":"comment"},{"by":"simcop2387","id":14230332,"kids":[{"by":"dom0","id":14230736,"kids":[{"by":"simcop2387","id":14235968,"parent":14230736,"text":"In this case it&#x27;d be like losing the index of the tape, but still needing to recover data off it.","time":1493620602,"type":"comment"}],"parent":14230332,"text":"Tape storage normally uses either an index (linear FS or off-tape, e.g. for object storage) or a more-or-less recoverable stream format (&quot;tar&quot;).","time":1493543277,"type":"comment"}],"parent":14230159,"text":"Depends on the media.

In the end the idea is to get to 20K classes and to sort directly into sets. This is very much a pipe dream at the moment but I think it is doable given a large enough set of samples. The problem is that you have to see all those parts at least a hundred times or so before it gets detected reliably.<p>3) too little :( The training data is still woefully insufficient but it is now good enough to bootstrap the rest. This took a while to achieve because without any sorted lego to begin with you have nothing to train with. So the first 20Kg or so were sorted by hand and imaged on the sorter without any actual sorting happening (everything into the run-off bin), then labeling the results by hand until the accuracy of the test set (500 parts or so) went over 80%. That was a week ago and since then it&#x27;s been improving steadily day-by-day.<p>4) one training run per night, typically a few 100 epochs on the current set but, this will change soon.

What I&#x27;ll probably do is offload training to one machine which will drop off a new set once per week or so and inference on another which is doing the sorting and capturing the new training data.<p>Checking the logged images for errors still takes up a bit of time though, but with the current error rate that is very well manageable.

Think about that: you want to grow from 100 to 1,000 users. How many hours did you spent on each one of those initial users? Now multiply it by 100. Seems scary, doesn&#x27;t it?<p>Better harness the userbase you have, and let them spread your product. If each one of your users can bring one more user, you&#x27;ve effectively doubled your userbase, and then again, and by the third time you are 200 users away from your goal.<p>This seems so easy and magical on paper, but you have to design your product&#x27;s virality: thinking about how it&#x27;s easier for your existing users to bring more of them, and rewarding both, either with cash or with influence.<p>A lot of business have been made with this strategy in mind.

I am obsessed about quality of performance and quality of output.  This has its pros and cons:<p>Pros<p>My little tool can do things other more popular tools cannot do, tends to be more stable, and executes extremely quickly.  From purely a technology perspective my tool is probably superior in many ways to other similar tools.  This has earned me a super loyal following and allows me freedoms to solve problems, provide enhancements, and solve bugs very quickly.<p>Cons<p>I am so focused on the code and technology that I don&#x27;t perform marketing or advertising of almost any kind.  I am entirely reliant upon organic search results, word of mouth from my users, and occasional feature announcements.  The challenge with this is that I have no control and often no awareness of my traffic.<p>Being obsessed with code quality and product quality the code is very terse and not friendly to many developers.  This means there is less interest from users to submit pull requests to the project.<p>The extremeness of this approach makes the popularity of my tool hard to gauge.  Last year it appeared I was on trajectory to become one of the most popular packages on NPM.  I pulled out of NPM because they kept breaking my package, and so I have completely lost that traffic.  I was about to exceed a million NPM downloads a month almost entirely from direct sources external to NPM.  This is what it means to be obsessed with product quality.<p>The single greatest burst of traffic to the website came when I published a new diff algorithm here last month.  I made the front page for a day and got about 50,000 visitors.<p>What I have learned is:<p>* If you are producing something worthy of demand in a way that is superior to everything else it will eventually get the attention it deserves.  If you are willing to accomplish those things the competition is either incapable or unwilling to accomplish you can compete no matter their funding or popularity.<p>* If the code is harder for newbs to instantly jump into your contribution community will be small or non-existent.<p>* If you damage the availability of your product most of your users will happily transfer their investment into something inferior.  For most people convenience is, to a point, more important than niche features or product quality.<p>* Without any marketing strategy the popularity of your product will grow exponentially (if it is worthy of growth).  So expect to invest years of effort before seeing any return on investment until that special tipping point occurs.","time":1493490357,"type":"comment"},{"by":"rmatte09","id":14227566,"kids":[{"by":"rossinimartins","id":14227615,"parent":14227566,"text":"<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=14191161\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=14191161</a>","time":1493486594,"type":"comment"}],"parent":14227063,"text":"How do you got your first 100 users?","time":1493486121,"type":"comment"},{"by":"Huhty","id":14228507,"kids":[{"by":"nickpsecurity","id":14229513,"parent":14228507,"text":"I&#x27;m your typical NoScript user from the days of web pages that were faster loading than the links we retrieved them on.

It was really hard attracting users when the entire site depends on other users (of which obviously at first we had very little of) for content.<p>However, we did several (mostly automated) things to increase our user count to 26,000+ members, which is where we stand right now. The main goal was to make sure that each user is catered to and getting exactly (or close to) what they are looking for.<p>1. Split up the content into several categories (14 to be exact). This allowed us to focus on specific categories such as  Science, Earth, Politics, etc. Each category has its own social media account (on Twitter, Tumblr, Medium, WP, etc.) where we share our highest voted RELEVANT user-submitted content automatically using IFTTT. Example: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;science.snapzu.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;science.snapzu.com</a><p>2. We also used the same user-submitted content to build our newsletter and send out the top relevant posts of the week for the &quot;tribes&quot; (communities like sub-reddits) that they are subscribed to. This attempts to get as many people to come back and often, a tactic extremely important when the community is dependent on other users coming back and contributing&#x2F;participating.<p>3. We create automatically generated &quot;top list&quot; posts for some of our top categories and share them on all our social channels, newsletters, certain relevant sub-reddits, etc. These again are dependent entirely on user-submitted content, and although I mentioned they are automated, they still require some work (for the intro quote, minor curating) but 95% of the work is automated. Each post takes approx 10-15 minutes to create, instead of several hours, and uses the past week&#x27;s top submissions as the main content. Example: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;snapzu.com&#x2F;teamsnapzu&#x2F;weekly-roundup-earth-and-nature-top-20-stories-of-the-week-of-april-20-27th-2017&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;snapzu.com&#x2F;teamsnapzu&#x2F;weekly-roundup-earth-and-nature...</a><p>4. Obviously there were also several things completely out of our control. Reddit had their massive debacle a couple years ago when Victoria got fired (she hosted their AMAs) which created a massive Reddit &quot;revolt&quot;. Over the course of a few weeks in July 2015 we had 40,000+ people come in from there, of which approximately 8000 signed up. But that obviously would not have happened if we were not &quot;somewhat known&quot; at this point. We were basically at the right place at the right time, as one of the few semi-known Reddit alternatives&#x2F;competitors. Because the &quot;Reddit revolt&quot; was somewhat big news, we also got mentioned in several articles (Daily Dot, Inc, Moz, etc) which brought in a few more thousand users.<p>We&#x27;re now using many of the things we learned from the entire 4 year process of growing our own community platform to help bloggers (and&#x2F;or website&#x2F;business owners) who are struggling with the same things we were (and still are). Many of the growth problems (and eventual tactics) involved are nearly identical mainly because of the chicken and egg problem I mentioned before. If you are curious it&#x27;s at <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogenhancement.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogenhancement.com</a>. It contains several tools we use ourselves and basically allows bloggers to start, run, and utilize their own communities to get more audience, engagement, content, and revenue. It also ties in beautifully to our platform that we&#x27;ve spent 4 years building and constantly improving on, so it&#x27;s a natural win&#x2F;win for both parties.<p>Hope this helps.

Containers have the semantics of isolating a <i>group</i> of processes, but not performing any <i>internal</i> isolation <i>between</i> the processes in the container. This is almost always what you want—you want &quot;your app&quot; to be able to have multiple processes, and to not have any security boundary between the <i>parts</i> of &quot;your app&quot;, just between &quot;your app&quot; and &quot;other apps&quot; or the OS. In other words, you want to have a single &quot;process&quot;—from the OS security subsystem&#x27;s perspective—whose threads happens to be composed of multiple PIDs, multiple binaries, and multiple virtual-memory mappings. You want to fork(2) + exec(2) without creating a new security context in the process.<p>Sandboxing would make perfect sense if single processes were always the granularity that &quot;apps&quot; existed at. Sometimes they are. Sometimes they&#x27;re not, and people do complex things with IPC-capability-objects. And sometimes, when they&#x27;re not, that fact pushes people toward <i>avoiding</i> multi-process architectures in favor of monolithic apps that reimplement functionality that already exists in some other program in themselves, in order to bring that functionality into their platform&#x2F;runtime so it can live in their process.<p>Containers let people avoid this decision, by just applying things like capabilities at the container level, rather than at the process level.<p>&gt; If someone can explain to me how isolating the system services in docker containers (which by the way are not isolated since they are privileged) does anything above and beyond what capabilities and the security features in OpenBSD provide then I&#x27;ll concede the point.<p>Completely apart from the above, my understanding of Rancher is that it&#x27;s the <i>Docker</i> part of &quot;Docker container&quot;, not the <i>container</i> part, that provides the benefit there.

It&#x27;s all one giant (poorly?) implemented binary either way. From a pragmatic standpoint I don&#x27;t see a difference. What&#x27;s the difference between one opaque binary vs another, except possibly one&#x27;s written in Go which I find easier to read if needed and is less likely to have buffer overruns.

Their system seem much more stable than any of the Linux containers and&#x2F;or systemd setups I&#x27;ve tried. It sticks a bit more to traditional unix design which makes sense to me. Items like the caching layer for containers build on ZFS snapshots, a well tested file system layer, rather than ad hoc userland tools. Triton also runs all of the orchestration layers in separate zones (containers) like RancherOS is trying to build. But each component is a simple(ish) service, it&#x27;s easy to `zfs list` and check on a container&#x27;s file system or fix it or backup, etc. Same with SVC or VM machine management which both have small simple tools that do one thing pretty well.<p>To that note, docker has been moving towards breaking out and using smaller daemons haven&#x27;t they?

All questions became crystal clear because of the book&#x27;s simplicity.<p>I don&#x27;t feel good about re-reading because there are tons of similar books which can explain things in intriguing way to leave a lasting impression. Unless I run out of options in that category, reading more seems  a better choice.","time":1493488039,"type":"comment"},{"by":"skadamou","id":14229283,"parent":14225331,"text":"For me it comes down to diminishing marginal returns. I figure that the first time I read a book I might retain 50% of what is written. Just the big picture stuff. Reading through that book again, I might retain an additional 20% of what the book has to offer. I’ll probably remember a lot more details this time around but I already had a general understanding of the concepts going into the second read. With each additional reading after that I may pick up on some new and interesting nuances that I did not understand the first few times around but I am really only adding a few more percentage points of understanding towards some hypothetical “Complete understanding”. With this in mind, there are really only a select few books that are worth the opportunity cost of beginning another.<p>I think that if you are reading to better yourself professionally however, there is good reason to revisit old topics since a few more percentage points of understanding might make a big difference when it comes to job performance relative to others in your field. This idea is probably best on display in athletics. Take baseball. The difference in skill between a minor league baseball player and one playing in the MLB relative to the skill level of the broader population is minuscule. However, to make any money playing baseball you have to be in the .000001% of the talent pool and thus it is worth it for minor league ball players to spend a great deal of time for just a few points boost in there batting average.","time":1493507475,"type":"comment"},{"by":"theparanoid","id":14227742,"kids":[{"by":"jnicholasp","id":14227846,"parent":14227742,"text":"Thanks for linking that.

That money, supplemented with an additional $2.1 million from Templeton, was the main funding source for Nautilus in the run-up to publication, and during its first two years in print. But the Templeton Foundation typically reduces support for startup ventures after the first three years, and, accordingly, it has dialed back funding for Nautilus, although it gave the magazine an additional $1.25 million in 2015, and a little more than $1.2 million last year.</i><p>Another business wholly dependent on investor patronage.<p>We need to examine how we can continue to crowdsource legitimate cultural and creative endeavors. It seems that we&#x27;re backpedaling to a medieval system, where science and art could only be done when bankrolled by a wealthy patron, whom the scientist&#x2F;artist would have to accommodate if they expected the patronage to continue. [The dependence on corporate sponsors is really a form of this too, and as paying subscribers have evaporated, these have become ever-more-crucial.]<p>Stringent copyright regimes have only brought us heavily sanitized, commercialized, vacuous media. I would argue loosening this would benefit most small writers and publishers. At the very least, limiting copyright terms and keeping some culturally relevant icons in the public domain would be a huge boon. For example, imagine if someone besides Disney could benefit commercially from the Star Wars franchise, which was originally released 40 years ago.

It&#x27;s definitely been growing in diversity of stories as well as users, but it&#x27;s still mostly about technology and startups.

For example, the Muffwiggler forum[2], which is a huge forum dedicated to modular synthesizers.  Everything conceivable in relation to synths is discussed there, with many subforums on specific manufacturers and subject.  It&#x27;s really active, and the discussions there are super informative.

The only interface to other modules is via message bus, so you can replace the module with one that publishes the same type of messages.<p>4) If the message bus is designed correctly, you can move the modules&#x2F;process to different machines, and they can access the message bus over network. Bus broker just sends the messages over TCP instead and that is totally transparent for both involved nodes.<p>Btw, I am still looking for an infrastructure library just like that: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=14222202\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=14222202</a>","time":1493563075,"type":"comment"}],"parent":14230787,"text":"&gt;Having a proper (intra-application) messaging system makes a certain class of problems -- problems that you just get used to in Java, and Go, and Rust, and C&#x2F;C++, and whatever -- just go away.<p>Interesting.

But it&#x27;s not dead.<p>Obviously these tools are not perfect, but seem like they might make &quot;serious&quot;&#x2F;in-depth OS development a tiny bit more fun and accessible. And besides these there&#x27;s also DOSBox&#x27;s built-in (and eminiently-hackable) debugger that you can enable at compile time (IIRC).<p>I also remember stumbling on a little assembler-emulator for DOS that could &quot;play&quot; the assembly backwards, which I&#x27;ve always thought was quite cute.

Depending on how long ago you did this (sounds like it was a while ago - not sure when QNX went 32-bit) you might remember quite a bit if you tried to do it again.<p>And if you did, you&#x27;ve already done the &quot;re-do QNX, fixing all the less-than-ideal bits that couldn&#x27;t be identified as such at design time&quot; thing - so you&#x27;d be going over it <i>a second time</i>, with potentially even more refined results.<p>&gt; <i>But an open source version of it would make big inroads into all kinds of embedded systems. But good luck getting the likes of NVIDIA to make a driver.</i><p>Eheheheh. The situation is not nearly that negative now! :D<p>First, you target Intel. This is simply tedious: there are real specifications floating around, along with a full GPLv2&#x27;d implementation in Linux that &quot;just&quot; needs normalizing (basically, distilling KMS and DRM out of the picture). As you go along, you may be able to get some assistance - Intel recently said hello to FreeBSD: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=13848258\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=13848258</a>, and I think you could describe QNX to be sort of on the same spectrum&#x2F;track as an OS ecosystem in some ways, so that might translate to not-entirely-closed-doors where&#x2F;when it would count. HD Graphics is a huge win to have available; many embedded systems (:D :D) don&#x27;t have discrete GPUs, and the on-chip GPU specifies two video heads (IIRC), can handle 1080p+, and generally from the standpoint of &quot;reimplement QNX&quot; provides an overkill level of hardware capacity&#x2F;capability. It would be more than enough to get in the door of making a serious MVP (that&#x27;s actually usable), if you will.<p>With some kind of established thing going on with Intel, work would begin to try and target AMD, specifically the APUs. This is likely where the NDAs would start, but it would be viable to do so because a) AMD would be able to see the Intel-only situation and want to compete and b) I expect there would be some sort of commercial thing with the OS happening at this point (eg, the MVP attracting some bites, either from VCs or industry) helping things along.<p>From there, it&#x27;d be a matter of going &quot;hey NVIDIA...?&quot; and either waiting 2E14 years^W ^W for a port or getting specs to help out.<p>I realize I&#x27;ve naïvely just described a very high-level timeline involving tens of man-decades of development, a noteworthily large team, and probably a 7 figure budget.

I was thinking of maybe making a website (hmm, what to call it - I have no idea) so people could have a hub&#x2F;point of reference to point to and figure out what to work on and stuff.<p>That being said, no rush; this sounds like a fun idea, best to keep it that way.

Sound, video, I&#x2F;O... file system... SMP... C++ GUI... POSIX... threads. Took 6 years (1994-2000). <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;AtheOS\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;AtheOS</a><p>Eventually the project was abandoned, but in 2002 a small group of enterprising developers took AtheOS&#x27; GPL&#x27;d codebase (\\o&#x2F;) and built Syllable from it: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Syllable_Desktop\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Syllable_Desktop</a>, <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;syllable.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;syllable.org</a>. They tidied up the UI a bit, added USB support and other things, and make slow progress forward.<p>Now, Syllable is certainly not QNX. But I wanted to say this: the person (or group) who does the sprint and gets to the point of &quot;ok, it&#x27;s out there now&quot; doesn&#x27;t have to be the same group that eventually maintains everything. It&#x27;s an interesting idea to weigh up, because it instantly puts an upper bound on total development time. That time might be years, but 5-6 years is not eg 20 years. (Methinks it&#x27;ll be interesting to hear Linus reflect on kernel development after he&#x27;s retired and can say what he really wants to, and can step back far enough to consider all of his ~40+ years of involvement.)<p>Now, sure, with a &quot;sprint then step back&quot; approach it&#x27;s impossible that there won&#x27;t be disappointment and frustration with the way some things end up being done by the new gatekeepers, but if the implementation is sketched out sufficiently well and the time is taken to get the fundamentals (and the thousands of little things) correct, that could well mitigate the worst of that problem.<p>The reason I say all this is because I noticed <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=14230456\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=14230456</a> which pointed to <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lobste.rs&#x2F;s&#x2F;ensbd6&#x2F;building_blackberry_qnx_7_desktop#c_bpjfb3\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lobste.rs&#x2F;s&#x2F;ensbd6&#x2F;building_blackberry_qnx_7_desktop...</a>, which said at the bottom:<p>&gt; <i>I’m with Animats that it’s surprising that nobody is cloning QNX in these microkernel projects given it’s architecture is open.

It would be an interesting nut to crack, because license changes (at least after public releases) are inelegant, and always run the risk of compromising confidence. This would take some interesting discussion: I personally hate the GPLv3, for example, but &quot;GPLv3 or contact us&quot; might be attractive to interests that need to draft a license from scratch (at least ideologically - of course a commercial license template would be filed away).<p>Another very attractive benefit I see is that everyone would be able to debate the finer points of QNX&#x27;s existing design as implemented, and debate what parts of the design are worth copying and what should be reconsidered. Benchmarking different workload types as well as collecting anecdotes could be useful here.<p>I won&#x27;t deny that QNX as a whole is huge, and that while building rebuilding the kernel in 4350 LOC (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=9477947\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=9477947</a>) might be fairly trivial, building everything else (<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;4266&#x2F;blackberry-playbook-review&#x2F;3\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;4266&#x2F;blackberry-playbook-revie...</a> says the kernel is 100K LOC, I presume this probably includes all the drivers and possibly some of userspace) is going to take, well, a while.<p>Haiku (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.haiku-os.org&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.haiku-os.org&#x2F;</a>) has been in slow development since 2001, and only got to R1 in 2012.

When you say &quot;open-source reimplementation of QNX that does X, Y and Z,&quot; you get to run with the existing context. So, rebuilding QNX could be sane in that regard.<p>But... Haiku&#x27;s binary compatibility <i>almost</i> feels like a committee meeting for the sake of meeting now. Haiku is locked to GCC 2.95 (and had to backport a bunch of critical fixes in order for that to be viable), doesn&#x27;t support BeOS R5 on PPC aka the BeBox (which is understandable, but notable), a bunch of private APIs aren&#x27;t going to be implemented, and <i>for all that</i>, only a handful of applications work.

I mean the pain of updating, upgrading, and adding to our system. Maybe the shop I was at just didn&#x27;t have things set up well, but as a result we were trapped on a specific version of neutrino while trying to interface with modern networked and front end systems. When we can easily upgrade a Linux kernel, apt&#x2F;yum&#x2F;pacman install a package, and have more modern versions of our toolchains, it was easy to justify the switch.

Sure you could use sockets or shared memory like Linux, but those QNX IPCs work fine (and I&#x27;d argue they were way easier to use, too).\n- Networked processes?

There are no citations I can follow, I&#x27;ve been curious for months.)<p>Sure, it probably has its fair share of little insanities (which are not common knowledge due to it being closed source) but it seems the things QNX gets right more than make up for them.<p>I have three very pointed questions. I&#x27;d love answers, suggestions or critique to any or all of them.<p>1. Does anyone know someone who knows someone [...] who might be able to unearth &quot;the right person to talk to&quot; at BlackBerry about QNX? While I&#x27;d probably want to defer the actual conversation to a person (or small group) more familiar with QNX from real-world experience in industry, my motivation behind adding this point is the hope that there may still be some glimmer of interest in a shared-source model, and that - and I really hope this - the source-access shutdown was simply due to insufficient time to refine the contracts (because the buyout was executed at a particularly fast-moving instant in time). My thinking is that BlackBerry doesn&#x27;t realize the QNX enthusiast community exists <i>because they were shut down</i>, and that if BlackBerry could be made aware of the fact that there are still big fans out there, it might be a simple matter of adding a couple clauses to some super-high-level document to eg re-allow academic access. (Yes, this point has a lot of naïveté in it, but one can dream, right?)<p>1a. As a continuation of the above question, if I had a question&#x2F;notation for BlackBerry&#x2F;QNX, it would be this: a) QNX had a shared-source release, and seemed to be making good progress with that (in short, people weren&#x27;t running off with the code); b) the automotive industry and other large interests sound like fairly stable considerations for QNX; could this affect (a) in the future in any way? If this <i>were</i> possible, would it be possible for Photon to be included (perhaps with no warranty or code updates)?<p>2. Can anyone who still has an old copy of the shared-source releases from before the BlackBerry buyout dig out the license files? I&#x27;m very very curious to see if there are any loopholes I could edge through sideways...?...<p>3. There is terribly little easily-findable documentation on the Internet helpful to OS enthusiasts who have <i>ahem</i> stumbled on certain TTHs and want to explore what they have found solely for personal research.

Since 1971 gold, along with every other commodity, has been optionalized. It doesn&#x27;t matter where or how it exists because what actually gets traded are options on the commodity. Now every once and a while somebody does actually take delivery but delivery is <i>very</i>, <i>very</i> costly and complicated for physical goods. Physical delivery involves not just the conveyance and storage fees but also the costs of integrity checks -- that is, literally going through each unit and verifying that what&#x27;s delivered satisfies some standard.<p>What the Federal Reserve has always been doing since it let foreign nations deposit gold for safe keeping is running a very inefficient options market. Gold is transferred in and  <i>very</i> modest storage fees are assessed each year (essentially the gold is stored <i>for free</i> [1]). Note that there are no real provisions for transferring the gold back out, this must be negotiated on a case-by-case basis. It is by all accounts a costly and tiresome thing to do.<p>Now the real question is -- why would any foreign government participate in such a scheme? And the answer is because it&#x27;s very beneficial for them. They get free gold storage in the safest vault in the world. And they don&#x27;t &quot;lose&quot; that wealth -- the NY Federal Reserve&#x27;s word is in fact &quot;good as gold&quot; and so that wealth can be leveraged much more efficiently than lugging around and cutting up actual gold bars. What does the United States get out of it? In fact it&#x27;s not so clear. Some politicians have reasonably asked why we&#x27;re paying a bunch of money to store ~7,000 tons of other people&#x27;s gold below Manhattan. It doesn&#x27;t really make much sense except that, well, it&#x27;s now been &quot;policy&quot; for 50 years and changing is very difficult and expensive.<p>In the end nobody really cares. There&#x27;s nothing suspicious going on. The author&#x27;s &quot;reading&quot; that Germany has forfeited 1200 tons of gold because they&#x27;re not allowed to &quot;count the gold&quot; is beyond ridiculous. The rationale for leaving gold in the Fed and moving slips of paper around is pretty sound -- it&#x27;s called modern banking. It&#x27;s mostly worked for 500 years. And the idea that gold will act as a reasonable substitute when the dollar collapses is just dumb. Because this is the thing that gold bugs never seem to understand: when&#x2F;if the dollar collapses it won&#x27;t be an isolated event. The implication is that the productive capacity of the USA has been zeroed out. Think about what events might cause this and ask yourself if, at this point, Germany (or anybody&#x27;s) biggest problem will be missing gold.<p>The article is painfully ignorant. The idea that it&#x27;s the gold buried under Manhattan that makes the dollar the reserve currency is not even wrong.<p>That said, if Germany does really want its gold the right thing to do would be for the Fed to make them pay standard market rates plus a Fed premium. Considering some banks charge as much as $300 an oz for such a delivery such a transaction would actually knock quite a bit off the national debt.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newyorkfed.org&#x2F;aboutthefed&#x2F;goldvault.html#storingthegold\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newyorkfed.org&#x2F;aboutthefed&#x2F;goldvault.html#storin...</a>","time":1493563674,"type":"comment"}],"parent":14231297,"text":"These may be reasonable propositions (or were when they applied, especially in the cases of a) and c)), but if and only if one assumes the deposits are effectively on call, and apparently they are not.<p>Your last sentence gets close to the key issue: if there is an innocent explanation, why have the parties who could remove the doubt over that explanation stopped talking about the issue?","time":1493560811,"type":"comment"}],"parent":14231235,"text":"No, not really. The &quot;nothing is amiss&quot; argument goes like this:<p>a) Until 1971, gold <i>was</i> regularly moved between central banks. The United States exchanged U.S. Dollars against gold and Germany made use of this. Obviously, it was easiest to just leave the gold where it was bought - in the United States. This was also where a lot of other central banks had (and still have) their gold, so it also made exchanges easier.<p>b) <i>After</i> 1971, trading gold might have become less frequent, and at the moment the Bundesbank states it does not sell or buy any gold at all. But still: Look at Switzerland who has sold a lot of their gold after they joined the IMF. By selling gold out of the US Fed vault, they could offer delivery at the US Fed, avoiding a lot of logistical hassle. Maybe the Bundesbank just wants to keep this option open, even though they don&#x27;t use it right now. It would be stupid to ship all the gold to Frankfurt, then decide to sell it in a couple of years from now, and then having to ship it back to the U.S. for the buyer.<p>c) Until 1989, it made sense to store gold outside of Europe to avoid it falling into the hands of the Soviet Union should they decide to invade (as suggested elsewhere in this discussion).<p>d) After 1989 and until recently, no one really cared about this topic. So it was easiest to just leave the gold where it was. Moving gold <i>is</i> a complicated business. The Bloomberg article linked above really makes it seem easier than it is. Yes, gold doesn&#x27;t take up much space, but because it is so valuable you can&#x27;t just put tons of gold into one plane &#x2F; ship &#x2F; truck - no one will sell you insurance for such a huge risk. You need to transport it in smaller batches, organizing secure transport and insurance for them, keeping the transports as secret as possible for security reasons. Also, you need to have sufficient storage available at the location where you want the gold to end up. And - again - you don&#x27;t want to store all of the stuff in a single space because you won&#x27;t get insurance for too much gold in one building.<p>I am not sure which explanation is the right one.

Using their ad networks they can track your browsing habits as a third party service on second party sites, which means they know who you are even when you have no account with them or are logged out.<p>Remember the fallout of SOPA.  SOPA scared the shit out of social media.

I am firmly against this action. I believe that these ISPs will operate solely in their own interests and not in the interests of what is best for the American public. In the past 10 years, broadband companies have been guilty of: deliberately throttling internet traffic, squeezing customers with arbitrary data caps, misleading consumers about the meaning of “unlimited” internet, giving privileged treatment to companies they own, strong-arming cities to prevent them from giving their residents high-speed internet, and avoiding real competition at all costs. Consumers, small businesses, and all Americans deserve an open internet. So to restate my position: I am against the chairman&#x27;s plan to reverse the net neutrality rules. I believe doing so will destroy a vital engine for innovation, growth, and communication.<p>This information is taken from this thread on Reddit: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;technology&#x2F;comments&#x2F;6894i9&#x2F;heres_how_to_contact_the_fcc_with_your_thoughts&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;technology&#x2F;comments&#x2F;6894i9&#x2F;heres_ho...</a>","time":1493507004,"type":"comment"},{"by":"nebabyte","id":14230180,"kids":[{"by":"studentrob","id":14230862,"kids":[{"by":"loup-vaillant","id":14231655,"kids":[{"by":"studentrob","id":14231912,"kids":[{"by":"loup-vaillant","id":14232425,"kids":[{"by":"studentrob","id":14232606,"kids":[{"by":"Nomentatus","id":14233496,"kids":[{"by":"studentrob","id":14233555,"kids":[{"by":"Nomentatus","id":14234541,"parent":14233555,"text":"Yup, Marx is unscientific.

The app may be able to run offline, except that it will not show an icon, or will not run an asynchronously loaded script.<p>- A cache update may fail during re-populating the cache (e.g. computer powered off), and the next time the offline app is loaded, the cache stores a mixture of old and new assets.<p>3) There are several layers of caches between the pixels and the server assets (to name a few: CDNs, web proxies, browser&#x27;s disk cache, service worker&#x27;s cache).

People routinely tell it to themselves without realizing its blatant falsity.<p>Most people find conflict unsettling and can handle it only in the smallest doses. People identify their ideas with themselves and take attacks or criticisms of them as personal slights. In written media like online discussion, these responses are amplified because there is little room for tone or other dampening&#x2F;mitigating signals from the speaker, and the written form makes the harsh words seem more final and official. A slighted person will often feel the need to respond on the record, whereas in person they may have been more likely to dismiss the remark.<p>Cognitive dissonance creates a powerful feeling of unease.

If your users do not have a way to ensure their experiences aligns with their tribal values and preferences, they will leave.<p>This is important for tech entrepreneurs and people seeking to &quot;bridge the gap&quot;.

I&#x27;m sure a lesser amount of engagement is also beneficial for skills that are somewhat more subjective, like art. These are great ways to stay apprised of the state of the art and to keep a pulse on the zeitgeist.<p>However, I think that the author is correct that a lot of fansites&#x2F;forums&#x2F;groups for [what are normally considered] casual interests are full of very obsessive people whose advice and opinions are not worth taking seriously. In some cases, these people may be completely non-functional and detached from reality.<p>It&#x27;s really important that we step back and allow ourselves to see and enjoy the whole picture, instead of allowing the bubble of our online hangouts to color perceptions too much. The big picture is usually much wider, much less exclusive, and much less angry, and it&#x27;s really healthy to appreciate that, <i>especially</i> when a community starts piling on.","time":1493600354,"type":"comment"}],"parent":14225886,"text":"<i>If you’re a talented artist, you probably spend your time actually making art rather than discussing technique online. Top amateur athletes are too busy actually training and playing to spend five hours a day on a forum for their hobby.</i><p>Is this <i>always</i> true?<p>I mean, of course it&#x27;s true at the <i>extremes</i>; if someone literally spends _all_ their waking hours posting on forums about X, they&#x27;re probably not getting very much X done.<p>But discussion and polemic is more complementary to some occupations and disciplines than others, one must acknowledge—as this article seemingly doesn&#x27;t. Publishing academics spend a lot of time on rigourous and structured rebuttals of each other&#x27;s theories, a kind of highly professional and esoteric Reddit with long bibliographies. They probably partake of some informal channels to soft-trial some of their positions and hone some of the thorny bits before pushing to production, so to speak. They might spend a lot of time on that.<p>Attorneys learn how to write more eloquent and persuasive pleadings and briefs by way of practice. A lot of practice. Surely some of them chisel the background knowledge and social skills required to operate in their world online. If that&#x27;s a serious learning tool, you&#x27;re probably using it more than 15 minutes&#x2F;day. You might even have a senior badge on some PHPBB legal board.<p>A lot of skills can be learned or improved on the Internet by reading and participating in sometimes contentious discussions about them. The strong religion in motorcycle repair and boating forums isn&#x27;t all puffery and neurotic wheel-spinning; a lot of the commentators are quite well-informed about the range of available componentry and DIY techniques, even if they sometimes bite each other&#x27;s heads off in arguments about the One True Way to overhaul a marine toilet or which ape hangers are the best.<p>The hours developers spend arguing about React vs. Angular on HN aren&#x27;t necessarily wasted; some of the discussions are rich, vibrant and informative, and make both the writers and the readers better developers or technical managers.<p>I myself learned a great deal about history and politics in high school by arguing heatedly with informed people online. If I were an aspiring politician or writer, expository writing in support of a particular ideological conviction would have legitimate value and relevance as a skill set, and this kind of exercise helps to hone it.<p>It takes a certain kind of personality to devote a lot of energy to online discussions. Some people don&#x27;t like to think and argue about methodology or meta- issues, or otherwise engage their analytical faculties very much when socialising. They just <i>do</i>. Good for them. However, this is a difference of style rather than substance. Everyone has to have &quot;continuing education&quot; of <i>some</i> description to remain fluent in their field. And yes, of course there&#x27;s a limit beyond which pure theory and no practice lies for simple reasons of time and economics, but it just depends.<p>So, I don&#x27;t disagree with the fundamental premise, but as is so often the case, this article paints the online world with a broad brush.","time":1493534944,"type":"comment"},{"by":"empressplay","dead":true,"id":14226173,"kids":[{"by":"dang","id":14229538,"kids":[{"by":"empressplay","id":14229982,"parent":14229538,"text":"My apologies.
