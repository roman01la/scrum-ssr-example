I find it fun to compare small pieces of code between the different compilers.<p>----<p>Shameless plug for an abandoned project of mine: (note: these demos appear to work in the latest Chrome on a wide monitor - YMMV; I didn&#x27;t know what I was doing.)<p>Back in 2012 I wanted to learn JS and had some ideas about a UI for teaching C programming with good visualizations. I was interested in building tools that would allow you to visualize in-memory data structures and step through the code (so you could watch a sorting algorithm, or tree manipulation, that kinda stuff.)<p>Anyway the full thing never panned out but I&#x27;ve got some lower-level demos:<p>Here&#x27;s a UI for running MIPS-like assembly: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;csclub.uwaterloo.ca&#x2F;~j3parker&#x2F;things&#x2F;evalc&#x2F;evalc3&#x2F;mips&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;csclub.uwaterloo.ca&#x2F;~j3parker&#x2F;things&#x2F;evalc&#x2F;evalc3&#x2F;mip...</a><p>(Hit &quot;run&quot; and click &quot;faster&quot; a few times) It started off as straight-MIPS but I realized emulating a real machine wasn&#x27;t necessary for the overall goal (teaching C and the C abstract machine) so I started adding convenient op-codes. All words (I think) of memory had tags to specify if the memory was initialized (maintained by the VM) stack&#x2F;heap (maintained theoretically by the C runtime) or code&#x2F;data. The goal was to make a C machine that was maximally friendly for education.<p>Here&#x27;s a C REPL that compiles to that assembly and runs it on the VM: \n<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;csclub.uwaterloo.ca&#x2F;~j3parker&#x2F;things&#x2F;evalc&#x2F;evalc&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;csclub.uwaterloo.ca&#x2F;~j3parker&#x2F;things&#x2F;evalc&#x2F;evalc&#x2F;</a> it compiles on keyup (I had vague goals of very quick feedback) and there is a line-edit below the source code that you can put C expressions into (e.g. type &quot;fib(12)&quot; without the quotes and hit enter - it should print 233 if you haven&#x27;t modified the code.)<p>The parser is mostly-complete C99 (typedefs were an issue - the first parser used a YACC-like generator which is known to have troubles here - the next version used a hand-rolled recursive descent parser. That one didn&#x27;t get finished but also had way better error messages, as expected.) The compiler (semantic analysis + codegen) didn&#x27;t support much of the language though, e.g. it doesn&#x27;t know how to code-gen for &gt; but it knows &lt;. So, the compiler is not at a very usable state.<p>I also had a V2 of the VM with an insane fixed 8-bit instruction set (with 200+ instructions) for a stack-based (not register) machine with a 32 bit address space. It would generate (with a poorly written bash script) the VM from the LaTeX documentation for the CPU which was weird. Here&#x27;s the PDF: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;csclub.uwaterloo.ca&#x2F;~j3parker&#x2F;things&#x2F;evalc&#x2F;evalc2&#x2F;vm&#x2F;docs&#x2F;cpu.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;csclub.uwaterloo.ca&#x2F;~j3parker&#x2F;things&#x2F;evalc&#x2F;evalc2&#x2F;vm&#x2F;...</a> the .tex file (in the same directory) has the impl of the instructions (not rendered to the PDF - that was the intent though) and it generates this: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;csclub.uwaterloo.ca&#x2F;~j3parker&#x2F;things&#x2F;evalc&#x2F;evalc2&#x2F;vm&#x2F;vm.js\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;csclub.uwaterloo.ca&#x2F;~j3parker&#x2F;things&#x2F;evalc&#x2F;evalc2&#x2F;vm&#x2F;...</a> It never did get finished but it had some promise.<p>---<p>It was a fun short project that got abandoned. I still think there would be value in an educational implementation of C, something that conforms to the spec but is in no way performant--instead, UB sanitizers everywhere and special hooks inside the runtime to aid in visualization and debugging (e.g. I want to look at memory and see all the allocations with links back to what line of code allocated this word of memory, etc.)<p>Source code (it&#x27;s all really bad):<p>- VM: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;j3parker&#x2F;mipsjs&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;mips.js\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;j3parker&#x2F;mipsjs&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;mips.js</a><p>- Jison grammar&#x2F;parser: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;j3parker&#x2F;jcc&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;c.jison\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;j3parker&#x2F;jcc&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;c.jison</a><p>- Better, but incomplete recursive-descent parser: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;csclub.uwaterloo.ca&#x2F;~j3parker&#x2F;things&#x2F;evalc&#x2F;evalc2&#x2F;parser.js\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;csclub.uwaterloo.ca&#x2F;~j3parker&#x2F;things&#x2F;evalc&#x2F;evalc2&#x2F;par...</a><p>- Compiler: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;j3parker&#x2F;jcc&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;jcc.js\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;j3parker&#x2F;jcc&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;jcc.js</a>","time":1493484244,"type":"comment"},{"by":"ravishah","id":14228057,"parent":14227122,"text":"I used to love the zilog z80, so super happy to see this\nUsed to use it for automation and running FORTH...","time":1493491593,"type":"comment"},{"by":"faragon","id":14228761,"parent":14227122,"text":"Still not being very efficient generating Z80 code, the SDCC is amazing! :-)<p>P.S.

I am obsessed about quality of performance and quality of output.  This has its pros and cons:<p>Pros<p>My little tool can do things other more popular tools cannot do, tends to be more stable, and executes extremely quickly.  From purely a technology perspective my tool is probably superior in many ways to other similar tools.  This has earned me a super loyal following and allows me freedoms to solve problems, provide enhancements, and solve bugs very quickly.<p>Cons<p>I am so focused on the code and technology that I don&#x27;t perform marketing or advertising of almost any kind.  I am entirely reliant upon organic search results, word of mouth from my users, and occasional feature announcements.  The challenge with this is that I have no control and often no awareness of my traffic.<p>Being obsessed with code quality and product quality the code is very terse and not friendly to many developers.  This means there is less interest from users to submit pull requests to the project.<p>The extremeness of this approach makes the popularity of my tool hard to gauge.  Last year it appeared I was on trajectory to become one of the most popular packages on NPM.  I pulled out of NPM because they kept breaking my package, and so I have completely lost that traffic.  I was about to exceed a million NPM downloads a month almost entirely from direct sources external to NPM.  This is what it means to be obsessed with product quality.<p>The single greatest burst of traffic to the website came when I published a new diff algorithm here last month.  I made the front page for a day and got about 50,000 visitors.<p>What I have learned is:<p>* If you are producing something worthy of demand in a way that is superior to everything else it will eventually get the attention it deserves.  If you are willing to accomplish those things the competition is either incapable or unwilling to accomplish you can compete no matter their funding or popularity.<p>* If the code is harder for newbs to instantly jump into your contribution community will be small or non-existent.<p>* If you damage the availability of your product most of your users will happily transfer their investment into something inferior.  For most people convenience is, to a point, more important than niche features or product quality.<p>* Without any marketing strategy the popularity of your product will grow exponentially (if it is worthy of growth).

It was really hard attracting users when the entire site depends on other users (of which obviously at first we had very little of) for content.<p>However, we did several (mostly automated) things to increase our user count to 26,000+ members, which is where we stand right now. The main goal was to make sure that each user is catered to and getting exactly (or close to) what they are looking for.<p>1. Split up the content into several categories (14 to be exact). This allowed us to focus on specific categories such as  Science, Earth, Politics, etc. Each category has its own social media account (on Twitter, Tumblr, Medium, WP, etc.) where we share our highest voted RELEVANT user-submitted content automatically using IFTTT. Example: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;science.snapzu.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;science.snapzu.com</a><p>2. We also used the same user-submitted content to build our newsletter and send out the top relevant posts of the week for the &quot;tribes&quot; (communities like sub-reddits) that they are subscribed to. This attempts to get as many people to come back and often, a tactic extremely important when the community is dependent on other users coming back and contributing&#x2F;participating.<p>3. We create automatically generated &quot;top list&quot; posts for some of our top categories and share them on all our social channels, newsletters, certain relevant sub-reddits, etc. These again are dependent entirely on user-submitted content, and although I mentioned they are automated, they still require some work (for the intro quote, minor curating) but 95% of the work is automated. Each post takes approx 10-15 minutes to create, instead of several hours, and uses the past week&#x27;s top submissions as the main content. Example: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;snapzu.com&#x2F;teamsnapzu&#x2F;weekly-roundup-earth-and-nature-top-20-stories-of-the-week-of-april-20-27th-2017&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;snapzu.com&#x2F;teamsnapzu&#x2F;weekly-roundup-earth-and-nature...</a><p>4. Obviously there were also several things completely out of our control. Reddit had their massive debacle a couple years ago when Victoria got fired (she hosted their AMAs) which created a massive Reddit &quot;revolt&quot;. Over the course of a few weeks in July 2015 we had 40,000+ people come in from there, of which approximately 8000 signed up. But that obviously would not have happened if we were not &quot;somewhat known&quot; at this point. We were basically at the right place at the right time, as one of the few semi-known Reddit alternatives&#x2F;competitors. Because the &quot;Reddit revolt&quot; was somewhat big news, we also got mentioned in several articles (Daily Dot, Inc, Moz, etc) which brought in a few more thousand users.<p>We&#x27;re now using many of the things we learned from the entire 4 year process of growing our own community platform to help bloggers (and&#x2F;or website&#x2F;business owners) who are struggling with the same things we were (and still are). Many of the growth problems (and eventual tactics) involved are nearly identical mainly because of the chicken and egg problem I mentioned before. If you are curious it&#x27;s at <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogenhancement.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogenhancement.com</a>. It contains several tools we use ourselves and basically allows bloggers to start, run, and utilize their own communities to get more audience, engagement, content, and revenue. It also ties in beautifully to our platform that we&#x27;ve spent 4 years building and constantly improving on, so it&#x27;s a natural win&#x2F;win for both parties.<p>Hope this helps.

In fact, in sampling 3 reviews from the front page of Google that used the word &quot;timely&quot;, all of them made the far more obvious connection: between THT and concerns about misogyny and sexism, a huge feature of the 2016 election.<p>Further, McArdle&#x27;s attempt to knock back the idea that the overall story of THT is something out of 1992† is incoherent and actually pretty fatuous.<p>Consider: McArdle goes out of her way to observe that Orwell --- to her the only realistic dystopian fiction writer --- cribbed details from communist dictatorships in the USSR and China. That 1984 doesn&#x27;t talk about (what she perceives to be) a credible future for the United States is excusable, because she can&#x27;t write a takedown of George Orwell.<p>Now consider: Islamic State didn&#x27;t exist in 1985, and in fact few people in the west appreciated the toll Islamic theocracy took on women in the middle east.

You say that the THT is more relevant, when 1984 actually features a lot of things that have come to pass and will continue to pass.<p>Compared to the future sketched in THT, we do not have Old Testament class hierarchies and uniforms. We do not have women being completely unpersoned by the .gov for not bearing children. We do not have the Constitution any more likely being suspended in any meaningful way than we did 16 years ago. We do not keep an underclass of women for breeding purposes. We do not ban women from reading or writing or playing Scrabble. We do not prevent women from voting. We do not prevent women from owning property. We have not rounded up African-Americans for forced relocation. We have not purged Catholics, Jews, or Muslims. We do not execute homosexuals. We do not enslave women.<p>Now, looking over at things that have actually come to pass from 1984, we have: Secret government torture rooms (Guantanamo Bay, and your own city&#x27;s black sites). Televisions with two-way cameras (Samsung smart TVs, in this case) surveilling owners. Effect two-minutes-hate of America&#x27;s enemies over on Fox News (or the Left&#x27;s or Right&#x27;s enemies if you read Twitter) every day. History being changed and edited electronically (Wikipedia edit wars and other operations). An ever-expanding lower class, Orwell&#x27;s proles or what people who don&#x27;t live in affluent neighborhoods might call <i>the poor</i>, kept asleep with booze and drugs and sexual imagery and vice. A permanent state of military conflict justifying the state security apparatus of every major player.<p>It&#x27;s pretty obvious that 1984 is the more relevant dystopia today, tptacek.

Skills need to be practiced, and you cannot practice critical thinking if you are surrounded by agreement all the time.

I suspect a similar process is happening with emulsified lipids as well.","time":1493527340,"type":"comment"},{"by":"Neliquat","id":14229517,"parent":14227382,"text":"(2015)<p>I wonder if any follow up studies have been done by now...","time":1493511255,"type":"comment"}],"id":14227382,"score":22,"url":"http://civileats.com/2015/02/25/how-emulsifiers-are-messing-with-our-guts-and-making-us-fat/","by":"walterbell"},"14227287":{"by":"perfmode","descendants":0,"id":14227287,"score":3,"time":1493483291,"title":"The Paradox of the Derivative","type":"story","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vKqVkMQHKk"},"14227665":{"by":"pella","descendants":0,"id":14227665,"score":13,"time":1493487119,"title":"Make Your Enemies Your Allies (HBR,2012)","type":"story","url":"https://hbr.org/2012/05/make-your-enemies-your-allies"},"14227240":{"time":1493482798,"type":"story","descendants":1,"title":"2017 EuroLLVM Developers' Meeting","kids":[{"by":"matt_d","id":14227244,"parent":14227240,"text":"- Slides: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;llvm.org&#x2F;devmtg&#x2F;2017-03&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;llvm.org&#x2F;devmtg&#x2F;2017-03&#x2F;</a><p>- Detailed program: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;llvm.org&#x2F;devmtg&#x2F;2017-03&#x2F;2017&#x2F;02&#x2F;20&#x2F;accepted-sessions.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;llvm.org&#x2F;devmtg&#x2F;2017-03&#x2F;2017&#x2F;02&#x2F;20&#x2F;accepted-sessions....</a>","time":1493482864,"type":"comment"}],"id":14227240,"score":1,"url":"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_R5A0lGi1AD12EbUChEnD3s51oqfZLe3","by":"matt_d"},"14227644":{"time":1493486910,"type":"story","descendants":7,"title":"Under the Trump Tax Plan, We Might All Want to Become Corporations","kids":[{"by":"valuearb","id":14228681,"kids":[{"by":"valuearb","id":14228768,"parent":14228681,"text":"BTW: Where Trump went wrong is that he should have proposed a 0% corporate rate, combine with treating dividend&#x2F;capital gains as ordinary income and subjected to payroll taxes.

The author is claiming that S corp owners want lower taxes if C corp owners get them, and the author is entirely correct that would be a huge loophole.<p>What he doesn&#x27;t say clearly enough is it&#x27;s ridiculous on it&#x27;s face, pass through entities don&#x27;t get double taxed already, and because C corps are double taxed they and their shareholders will still pay as much if not more taxes than the shareholders of passthrough entities with similar levels of income. C corps will still pay on average 20% given state taxes, combined with state and federal taxes on dividends their high income shareholders will certainly pay over 40% combined.<p>In CA a highest bracket taxpayer receiving dividends from a C corp would pay 10% State Corporate, 15% Federal, 13% State income, 20% federal dividend, or 47% total taxes on every dollar of profit. If their business is an S corp, they&#x27;d pay 13% state taxes, and 39% federal, which works out to a nearly identical 47% rate. But for the S Corp, no one pays 39% on all their income, as I wrote above they only pay around 28% on their first $400k, so again the pass through entity is going to be lower tax than a C corp even with Trumps proposed tax cut.<p>For example, if you made $1M after deductions, you would pay $350k in federal income tax, or 35% even though you were deep in the 39% bracket, even at the top CA tax rate your total income taxes would be around 44% with a pass-through.

The 15% corporate rate would be on every dollar of profit, just as the 15% dividend rate would be on every dollar of distribution, so effectively he&#x27;s be paying 30% on nearly 100% of his income instead of 10% on first $9k, 15% on next $20K, 25% on next $50k, 28% on the next $100k, etc.<p>If you make $191k, you owe $46,500k in taxes (obviously ignoring deductions).

Containers have the semantics of isolating a <i>group</i> of processes, but not performing any <i>internal</i> isolation <i>between</i> the processes in the container. This is almost always what you want—you want &quot;your app&quot; to be able to have multiple processes, and to not have any security boundary between the <i>parts</i> of &quot;your app&quot;, just between &quot;your app&quot; and &quot;other apps&quot; or the OS. In other words, you want to have a single &quot;process&quot;—from the OS security subsystem&#x27;s perspective—whose threads happens to be composed of multiple PIDs, multiple binaries, and multiple virtual-memory mappings. You want to fork(2) + exec(2) without creating a new security context in the process.<p>Sandboxing would make perfect sense if single processes were always the granularity that &quot;apps&quot; existed at. Sometimes they are. Sometimes they&#x27;re not, and people do complex things with IPC-capability-objects. And sometimes, when they&#x27;re not, that fact pushes people toward <i>avoiding</i> multi-process architectures in favor of monolithic apps that reimplement functionality that already exists in some other program in themselves, in order to bring that functionality into their platform&#x2F;runtime so it can live in their process.<p>Containers let people avoid this decision, by just applying things like capabilities at the container level, rather than at the process level.<p>&gt; If someone can explain to me how isolating the system services in docker containers (which by the way are not isolated since they are privileged) does anything above and beyond what capabilities and the security features in OpenBSD provide then I&#x27;ll concede the point.<p>Completely apart from the above, my understanding of Rancher is that it&#x27;s the <i>Docker</i> part of &quot;Docker container&quot;, not the <i>container</i> part, that provides the benefit there.

That money, supplemented with an additional $2.1 million from Templeton, was the main funding source for Nautilus in the run-up to publication, and during its first two years in print. But the Templeton Foundation typically reduces support for startup ventures after the first three years, and, accordingly, it has dialed back funding for Nautilus, although it gave the magazine an additional $1.25 million in 2015, and a little more than $1.2 million last year.</i><p>Another business wholly dependent on investor patronage.<p>We need to examine how we can continue to crowdsource legitimate cultural and creative endeavors. It seems that we&#x27;re backpedaling to a medieval system, where science and art could only be done when bankrolled by a wealthy patron, whom the scientist&#x2F;artist would have to accommodate if they expected the patronage to continue. [The dependence on corporate sponsors is really a form of this too, and as paying subscribers have evaporated, these have become ever-more-crucial.]<p>Stringent copyright regimes have only brought us heavily sanitized, commercialized, vacuous media. I would argue loosening this would benefit most small writers and publishers. At the very least, limiting copyright terms and keeping some culturally relevant icons in the public domain would be a huge boon. For example, imagine if someone besides Disney could benefit commercially from the Star Wars franchise, which was originally released 40 years ago.

This might be because economic models pursue equilibria of supply and demand, but just as there is a lowest common denominator of both there is also a highest common factor of which economic models take no account, and therefore under-finance.","time":1493491789,"type":"comment"},{"by":"johnnydoe9","id":14227799,"parent":14227337,"text":"Just recently discovered Nautilus and it is really high quality stuff, I think I&#x27;ll get a premium membership too after reading the Cormac McCarthy issue.","time":1493489070,"type":"comment"},{"by":"Heliosmaster","id":14230829,"parent":14227337,"text":"If only their printed version wasn&#x27;t so expensive here in Europe for the shipping...","time":1493546521,"type":"comment"},{"by":"zajd","id":14227503,"kids":[{"by":"almostApatriot1","id":14227750,"parent":14227503,"text":"if my order number indicates anything, its not higher than the low 30K&#x27;s.","time":1493488314,"type":"comment"},{"by":"qubex","id":14227598,"kids":[{"by":"okreallywtf","id":14227718,"parent":14227598,"text":"Lets see what we can do about that!
