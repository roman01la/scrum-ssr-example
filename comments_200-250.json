I had installed Slackware 3.6 (with a 2.0.36 Linux kernel) from floppies in 1998. This was a great experience because Slackware at this time was actually distributed in floppies (!)<p>Notice that I had downloaded these floppies through a 55.6 kbps dialup line (!!) from the Slackware ftp server (!!!)<p>The great thing about the Slackware distribution was that it was separated in &quot;subsystems&quot; each one being more or less standalone and being able to download and install separately. So there was the &quot;base&quot; subsystem which was on N floppies (I can&#x27;t remember probably around 6) that contained the Linux kernel, libraries, bash and a couple of other useful utilities which could be downloaded, installed and with this you could start using Linux! And then there were various extra subsystems, for example the &quot;development&quot; subsystem that contained gcc, the &quot;X&quot; subsystem (with the FVWM window manager IIRC) etc. This made it really great to be downloaded through a dialup line.<p>I can remember various great stories from my installation and configuration process, for example becoming an expert in how disk partitioning works, configuring the modem by giving it AT commands (to dial my ISP&#x27;s phone I needed to issue the ATX3DT command followed by the number), to make my (ISA) sound card work I needed to boot on windows (95) so that it&#x27;s IRQ and memory address was configured properly and only then then (cold) reboot on Linux so it would work (!), using autoconfigure&#x2F;make&#x2F;gcc to compile stuff (this actually is needed and in 2017), configuring X by editing text files and playing with my monitor resolution and refresh rate etc.<p>Happy days !","time":1493201595,"type":"comment"},{"by":"rconti","id":14204281,"parent":14201474,"text":"Ditto, BTDT, got the t-shirt.

It lets me get things done without dealing with silly things.<p>Let&#x27;s quickly list what I sorely miss when switching to my Linux machine:<p>* Multiple monitor support: connect any number of monitors, any time, and have them Just Work. HiDPI or not, doesn&#x27;t matter. The OS even remembers which of your windows where placed on which monitor at which size, and will do its best to move them when you connect a monitor. No other OS even comes close.<p>* Consistent keybindings (Emacs-style) in <i>all</i> windows and dialogs. Control-a always gets me to the beginning of the line, whether in a text editor or in a file-open dialog box.<p>* Reasonably consistent keybindings in apps. Can expect Cmd-q to quit every app.<p>* Flawlessly working suspend&#x2F;resume on laptops.<p>* Full-screen any app and it works fine.<p>* Apps like LaunchBar (I think quicksilver used to be a free alternative).<p>* Spotlight, which finds everything.<p>* Ability to remap any key to whatever I want and have it work everywhere.<p>* Drag &amp; drop everywhere. And if you laugh at this, consider that this is coming from a command-line guy with 25 years experience with computers. The way Mac does drag &amp; drop is faster and more convenient than fiddling with command line. For example, did you know you can drop a file or a directory from anywhere into any file&#x2F;open dialog box?<p>* Apps like Simplenote, Bear, Ulysses: excellent tools for specific purposes.<p>* TextExpander.<p>* Predictable ubuquitous working clipboard.<p>For me, switching over to my Ubuntu machine is an exercise in frustration. I can&#x27;t redefine my keys, there is nothing like TextExpander, multiple monitors just don&#x27;t work unless stars align just right and you have all the monitors in just the right order at boot time and you better not mix hidpi with normal. Drag and drop is nonexisting. Copy&#x2F;paste is a free-for-all where each app does things differently and you have multiple clipboards (Ctrl-V vs middle mouse click).<p>Basically, in order to get things done, I&#x27;d much rather work on a Mac.<p>A side note: to really understand why the Mac is so good, you have to work on it for a while, with someone showing you things (like dragging files into file&#x2F;open dialogs).

I prefer it because it reveals the total wrong-headedness of this style of reasoning. The argument is to turn it around and say &quot;what evidence do we have that the limit <i>is</i> us?&quot; A human level of intelligence seems like an incredibly and oddly specific level to be the maximum permissible by physics. And oddly specific claims need to be treated with extreme skepticism, because they carry high entropy, in violation of Occam&#x27;s razor.<p>If you want to know what x equals, you don&#x27;t pick a number, say, 2, assume x=2, and ask people to provide you with reasons why it shouldn&#x27;t be 2. There&#x27;s an infinity of numbers, and the odds are just overwhelmingly against x happening to be 2. You start with the assumption that x could be literally any of the infinity of numbers, and start looking for evidence which narrows it down.\nMore concretely, if you want to know the physical limit to intelligence, you start with the assumption that it could be anything, constrained by the evidence that&#x27;s currently available. In this case, the evidence is that human intelligence provides a <i>lower bound</i> for the maximum physically allowable intelligence.<p>Positing that our intelligence is the maximum possible becomes even more suspect when you consider the process by which our intelligence came about - evolution.<p>Firstly, evolution is a process which tends towards reproductive fitness, <i>not</i> necessarily towards intelligence. Intelligence is selected for to the extent that it makes something more likely to reproduce, and no more, and it probably isn&#x27;t the case that more smarts universally leads to more reproduction. In fact, most modern research suggests the opposite, with people with higher IQs having less sex.<p>Secondly, we know that natural selection gets stuck in local optima. If your species is on top of a 10 smart-points hill, and in order to get to get to the 1000 smart-points hill over there your species has to mutate in a direction that makes it stupider before it gets smarter, your species is going to stay on the 10 smart-points hill. This is because individuals that mutate stupider in the direction of the 1000-point hill will be selected against.<p>Thirdly, natural selection just isn&#x27;t a very powerful optimization process. It works by <i>random mutation</i>, and it takes a lifetime to make a minuscule change which may or may not be in the right direction. Even if natural selection was solely optimizing for intelligence, and it could somehow avoid local optima, there would be no particular reason to believe that the world had existed long enough for the smartest possible organism to evolve.<p>Fourthly, as _greim_ touches upon, evolution has a very limited medium to work with. All it can do is change the sequence of DNA base pairs, and produce inefficient meat machines that run on respiration. There are all sorts of complex arrangements of matter which might be intelligent, and biological ones are only a tiny subset of those possible arrangements. The odds of the smartest system physically possible residing in that little biological subset are tiny to begin with, and only get smaller as you consider the more direct arguments against biological systems mentioned above, like sluggish neural transmissions, etc.","time":1493308012,"type":"comment"}],"parent":14205042,"text":"&gt; Temperature is not infinite [...] There is finite space and time.

Yes, of course intelligence has many components (depending on how you measure it), but that&#x27;s not an argument against superhuman intelligence. I&#x27;m reminded of the joke paper claiming machines can never surpass human largeness, because what does largeness even mean?

When I asked Ray Kurzweil, the exponential wizard himself, where the evidence for exponential AI was, he wrote to me that AI does not increase explosively but rather by levels. He said: “It takes an exponential improvement both in computation and algorithmic complexity to add each additional level to the hierarchy…. So we can expect to add levels linearly because it requires exponentially more complexity to add each additional layer, and we are indeed making exponential progress in our ability to do this. We are not that many levels away from being comparable to what the neocortex can do, so my 2029 date continues to look comfortable to me.”</i><p>&quot;<i>What Ray seems to be saying is that it is not that the power of artificial intelligence is exploding exponentially, but that the effort to produce it is exploding exponentially, while the output is merely raising a level at a time.

To be able to ship a <i>static, EOLed</i> copy of XP that could run IE6 indefinitely, without that causing problems, your compatibility layer would need to be a lot less like &quot;Windows XP Mode&quot; or Rosetta, and a lot more like DOSBox or qemu.<p>There is <i>one</i> case where this already happens: many pieces of IBM z&#x2F;OS software have been wrapped in layers of hard-isolated emulators for decades now, such that programs from the 70s are able to continue running without recompilation, atop a stack of VMs, where many of the intermediary pieces of VM software have <i>themselves</i> long been EOLed.","time":1493163442,"type":"comment"}],"parent":14199014,"text":"OSX did this when they went from 68k to PPC [0], from PPC to x86[1], and also with Classic to support macos 9[2].

I guess not because it&#x27;s not really in the common format. But from a quick look, it actually looks interesting, so why not try to submit it somewhere, e.g. some image conference? But you really should work on the format. I assume that this was not done with LaTeX? Then, in the table in your experimental results, what you are also comparing is number of parameters, and maybe train time, and inference time, and maybe memory consumption during inference, so that should all be also in the table. Also, there should be one or two figures which give small sketches of your models blocks, which helps to better understand the difference to e.g. XCeption. Also, as I understand, QuickNet is mostly based on XCeption? But XCeption is not in the table of your experimental comparisons. Also you mention MobileNets which is also not there. You should add that.

And indeed friction is probably independent of nations (and their differing laws and cultures), so I&#x27;ll focus on turnover.<p>So, turnover. The legal notice period in Germany is (ignoring exceptions) at least one month, and up to seven months <i>by law</i>. Often employer and employee contractually agree on even longer minimums, three months are quite usual. There&#x27;s also an unspoken expectation that permanent employees are in for the long haul.\nBy contrast, IIRC many US States allow essentially zero notice period, and the famous two weeks&#x27; notice is essentially just courtesy.<p>Culturally, there&#x27;s also stronger (albeit eroding) attachment between employers and employees. Especially in Mittelstand companies, such as Grohmann seems to be, the owner takes the stance of a benevolent patriarch, taking his responsibility for his employees seriously, and workers tend to reciprocate, and be very protective of their boss.\nIn fact, such a company structure and climate may well be a factor for when considering an employment offer.<p>Since identification with a company can thus be very strong, there would be considerable reluctance to leave, especially at such a critical time. You don&#x27;t just leave your colleagues and your customers hanging.\nIn fact, perhaps it was this sentiment which caused Klaus Grohmann to throw in the towel, when he realised he was expected to work against the best interest of his clients (and, by extension, employees).<p>I assume that such a departure of a patriarch will be a strong signal to the rest of the company.","time":1493376696,"type":"comment"}],"parent":14214100,"text":"Would you care to elaborate?","time":1493360214,"type":"comment"}],"parent":14213858,"text":"&gt; Turnover at an acquired company isn&#x27;t unusual, nor is friction in the transition.<p>Things are a bit different in Germany than in the USA when it comes to this.","time":1493321936,"type":"comment"},{"by":"NathanKP","id":14213915,"kids":[{"by":"snovv_crash","id":14214236,"kids":[{"by":"williamscales","id":14214995,"kids":[{"by":"snovv_crash","id":14217204,"kids":[{"deleted":true,"id":14230155,"parent":14217204,"time":1493526313,"type":"comment"}],"parent":14214995,"text":"No, no they didn&#x27;t.

They would have never made it by themselves.<p>Tesla should not be surprised if Grohmann will see a tit for tat and run into difficulties cooperating with other German suppliers, which they most certainly rely on.","time":1493320712,"type":"comment"},{"by":"swalsh","id":14213893,"kids":[{"by":"Animats","id":14214007,"kids":[{"by":"jacquesm","id":14214119,"kids":[{"by":"dnh44","id":14215011,"parent":14214119,"text":"It&#x27;s standard practice already in at least one industry I know of.","time":1493329558,"type":"comment"}],"parent":14214007,"text":"I predict a lot more attention to &#x27;change of control&#x27; clauses in supply contracts.","time":1493322103,"type":"comment"}],"parent":14213893,"text":"That was a shock to the material-handling industry.

Unlike other companies, the existence of Tesla is not only to make money. If it were only about this one goal, then I can tell you that the founding of a completely new car manufacturer would definitely not have been the smartest way. Our foundation and the foundation of everything we do is to accelerate the advent of sustainable energy. The welfare of our planet is in great danger, and in order to solve this problem, we need a sustainable solar energy production, we need a sustainable way to store the energy in stationary batteries and we need a sustainable way to consume this energy with electric vehicles. It is critical of the future of humanity to solve this problem – we all want a better world for future generations.<p>Tesla has made a number of important steps towards achieving this mission in the last 14 years of our existence, but none is more important and can make a bigger difference than Model 3. For the first time ever, there will be an electric vehicle that people can afford and which people love. When Tesla was founded, no one thought that an electric vehicle could ever be more than a golf cart. Today, Model S is the best-selling vehicle in its class. Model X is fast to pick up and recently won a golden steering wheel. And Model 3 is on the brink of production start – just one year after the most successful product launch ever. After the Model 3, many other vehicle products will come, for which Tesla Grohmann will play a key role. To name just a few, which have already been publicly announced (there will be many more): We are developing Model Y (an affordable mid-range SUV), a heavy-duty semitrailer, a pickup and the next generation of the roadster sports car.<p>And these are only the cars. Tesla is about to launch a new solar roof into the market that will completely change the importance of the use of solar energy. Tesla will soon produce more batteries than the entire world has produced in 2013. These batteries will enable everything to be operated with sustainable energy, including the cars we manufacture. I was never more optimistic about the future of Tesla. Although it is not what drives us, Tesla has the real potential to be one of the most valuable companies in the world.<p>We bought Tesla Grohmann because we believe that Tesla Grohmann will play an important role in creating this future. It is not enough to produce cool products. To be successful, we need factories that are as good as the products themselves.<p>This brings us to the current topics at Tesla Grohmann:<p>First, the question of trust and the longing of every employee for job security. I understand that you are concerned about our decision to focus on Tesla projects instead of serving external customers. We have made this decision, because just so much work has to be done on critical Tesla projects. We really have so much to do that we will be able to hire even more extraordinary talents, and we plan not only an expansion of the team, but also our production facility in Prüm. For all these reasons, I would like to assure everyone at Tesla Grohmann that we will not be able to reduce our workforce in the foreseeable future, Even after these five years, we are expecting further growth at Tesla Grohmann and do not expect any personnel reductions. However, we wanted to give you absolute security for a definite period of time. This is a promise you can rely on and I will ensure that it is also formally implemented.<p>Second, on remuneration. Last week, we announced that each employee at Tesla Grohmann Tesla will receive shares worth 10,000 euros (US $ 10,000), distributed quarterly over the next four years, and an immediate bonus of more than 1,000 euros in cash. This is just the beginning for each Teammitgled. We will also enter into discussions immediately with the works council to ensure that the remuneration of each individual employee is competitive and corresponds to the local cost of living. Of course, no one at Tesla Grohmann should earn less than he can expect on the local labor market; Just as no one would reasonably require the remuneration in Prüm to be as high as in cities like Stuttgart or Munich, where the cost of living is much higher. In any case, every Tesla Grohmann employee will have the chance to earn considerably more salaries and shares than is usual in the industry and relative to the cost of living in Prüm. Unlike other automotive manufacturers, each Tesla employee receives Tesla shares in addition to salary. These shares can be easily sold for money, but they also open up the possibility of earning much more through stock appreciation. The tenfold increase in our share price over the past five years has made our shareholding exceptionally profitable for our Tesla employees. I firmly believe that we have the potential for a further ten-fold increase over the next five to ten years. That would make a total value of € 100,000 from the share of the share of € 10,000. Although we would not recommend it to anyone, because it is very likely less worthwhile, all those who would rather have a simple cash bonus, instead of the shares, would demand 2,500 euros in cash every year. Tesla firmly believes that extraordinary performance must be rewarded with additional cash and share bonuses. So this is only the beginning.<p>Thirdly, it is clear that you would like to see more changes at the workplace. At Tesla, we are proud to offer a pleasant, fair, and exciting work environment. It is very important for me that you like to work every morning. We have drawn up a long list of change measures to bring Tesla Grohmann to the conditions at other Tesla locations, as well as changes that are specific to Tesla Grohmann and which we are now trying to implement. This list will be visible in all buildings visible to all. We will update the list on a regular basis so that everyone can see what changes have already been made, which are currently being implemented and which will be implemented soon. You should see every week that improvements happen.<p>Finally, I know that IG Metall wants to bring the workforce of Tesla Grohmann on the union line. I would like to share my thoughts with you. It is my firm belief that the separation of the workplace into “executives” and “employees” does not create a good working environment. We want to create a system of equality without artificial barriers so that someone can start as a trainee and one day lead the entire company. This is why we eliminate all the special privileges of the executives. For example, everyone will have equal access to parking, eating the same tables, and there will be no management offices. I am convinced that managers should work at the forefront, in the same work environment as the entire team. Even though I run the company myself, I still do not have my own office and often moved my workplace to the most challenging area in the factory and slept on the factory floor when there was a real crisis. Managers should always take care of their team before they take care of themselves – the supervisor is there to serve his team – not the other way round.<p>As I said at the beginning, everything at Tesla serves our mission and I do not believe that IG Metall is sharing our mission. They have publicly announced in the press that electric cars do not take care of them. In addition, they have a real conflict of interest because their top priority will always be the members of the hugely established automotive manufacturers: their potential of membership is much greater than at Tesla Grohmann.<p>I would like to thank you for all the contributions you have made to Grohmann over the years. I look forward to what we can create as a tightly integrated team together.<p>Elon","time":1493329945,"type":"comment"},{"by":"prklmn","id":14213826,"parent":14213611,"text":"Model 3 deliveries rescheduled to sometime, eventually...","time":1493319195,"type":"comment"},{"by":"rm_-rf_slash","id":14213721,"kids":[{"by":"dsp1234","id":14213801,"parent":14213721,"text":"<i>absent from this article was an assessment of Grohmann&#x27;s contributions to Tesla</i><p>The second and third paragraph of the article explain who Grohmann is in relation to Tesla:<p><i>counting on Grohmann Engineering&#x27;s automation and engineering expertise</i><p><i>described Klaus Grohmann and the company he founded as a &quot;world leader in highly automated manufacturing&quot;.</i><p>Later:<p><i>the workforce felt insecure about becoming so dependent on one client after the founder&#x27;s departure.</i><p>The rift is explained throughout as being basically, should Grohmann Engineering focus on Tesla above it&#x27;s prior automative relationships with Tesla competitors?

They know what they want but they also know it is bad for them, they just can&#x27;t help themselves.<p>You could counter this by being fierce and stern and saying &#x27;no, you must eat your spinach before dessert!&#x27; and probably have some success, if your business was based on hard-nosed determination. Amazon can do that, because they are tougher than Wall Street and will do what&#x27;s best for Amazon, garnering respect.<p>Tesla&#x27;s different. Musk&#x27;s positioning is the foggy-eyed mystic, the guy with a vision WAY beyond what anybody else dares to have. Whether or not this is true this is how he has to behave. So, if Musk says things like &#x27;ectually capital isn&#x27;t even real, so the share price doesn&#x27;t matter, it just slightly affects how fast we can roll out batteries and synergize with going to Mars&#x27;, if it was a normal company the stock market would go WHACK and it would be goodbye Tesla.<p>Instead, since Musk is Musk and since the whole concept of Tesla&#x2F;SpaceX is based on that impossibly grand vision, the stock market sort of gets wide eyes and goes quiet, and are careful not to cross Musk.<p>It&#x27;s a type of dominance behavior. He doesn&#x27;t have to yell at them: he acts like they&#x27;re BENEATH him, and since the stock market likes to go for short-term thinking, technically they are. He can&#x27;t go to Mars etc. while complying with stock market expectations because his business would implode. So he does it anyway and they interpret his arrogance as dominance, which it is.<p>Tesla, Amazon, and Uber each have their own type of dominance behaviors with the stock market. Tesla is the visionary seeing the burning bush and unaware of anything the stock market says, and they command awe. Amazon is the hard-bargainer who understands what the stock market wants, but won&#x27;t trade away their own power, and they command respect.

Whether or not they succeed is something that many are interested in, just as it seems you are. Tesla has very ambitious goals in terms of Model 3 production and many people have expressed doubts whether they&#x27;ll be able to meet those goals. Missing those goals could have a significant impact on the long-term success of the company. To meet these goals, Tesla acquired the automation company of which Grohmann was the CEO. If the departure of Grohmann results in management difficulties or departures of other Grohmann Automation staff, this could have a significant impact on whether Tesla meets these goals.<p>A wait-and-see attitude can make sense if you&#x27;re just interested in the outcome and don&#x27;t think you have any stake or ability to influence the company or the industry.

And what is the point of misleading them?<p>And that really makes me wonder, what exactly is Dr. Jassby trying to say here?\nI could completely understand an article that says &quot;Hey, while fusion has some desirable properties, it is going to be expensive, and from where I sit it is going to be more expensive than the power it generates is worth.&quot; That is a perfectly reasonable discussion to have and one that should be had with people looking at building fusion devices.<p>It also makes me wonder why he doesn&#x27;t mention some of the other groups who are designing and building much simpler and perhaps more efficient systems (in terms of net energy production). Does he not keep up with the field or does he omit them because they don&#x27;t add to the generally negative tone? All in all this article left me with more questions than insights.","time":1493230187,"type":"comment"},{"by":"sundvor","id":14209418,"parent":14202488,"text":"I thought I&#x27;d link in DotNetRock&#x27;s recent geek out session on fusion power - others might like it, very much on topic:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;player.fm&#x2F;series&#x2F;dot-net-rocks&#x2F;fusion-power-update-geek-out\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;player.fm&#x2F;series&#x2F;dot-net-rocks&#x2F;fusion-power-update-g...</a>","time":1493271489,"type":"comment"},{"by":"madaxe_again","id":14202771,"kids":[{"by":"leephillips","id":14202982,"kids":[{"by":"SomeStupidPoint","id":14203070,"kids":[{"by":"Spare_account","id":14203474,"kids":[{"by":"leephillips","id":14203611,"kids":[{"by":"Spare_account","id":14203733,"kids":[{"by":"leephillips","id":14204766,"parent":14203733,"text":"Thanks.

The more I think about it the more I think it&#x27;s probably a pipe dream.<p>The idea appears so simple an elusive: combine Hydrogen into Helium (and there are variations that use Helium, particularly He-3 as a fuel), which releases energy. Hydrogen is essentially limitless (He, particularly He-3, less so). Stars do it all the time.<p>The two big problems are of course:<p>1. Containment. How do you contain something that&#x27;s heated up to millions of degrees? Magnetic containment has been the obvious candidate since hydrogen heated sufficiently loses it&#x27;s electrons and becomes a H+ ion but this so far seems far easier said than done; and<p>2. Neutrons. Fusion using deuterium, tritium, He-4 and He-3 releases varying amounts of neutrons. These can&#x27;t be magnetically contained (obviously) and they&#x27;re destructive. We can achieve fusion but neutrons end up pretty quickly destroying the containment vessel.<p>Stars solve the first problem quite easily: with gravity. This isn&#x27;t something that&#x27;s useful to us. A star exists in a state of a balance of two opposing forces: gravity from the sheer their sheer mass trying to crush them vs the outward pressure of the fusion processes they&#x27;re undergoing.<p>The differences in potential size are massive. A star like our own sun will eventually become a red giant extending about to the orbit of the earth. That&#x27;s 150 _million_ km. Likewise a star larger than ours can end up compressed to something 10 miles or less across. This just illustrates the differentials in forces involved.<p>At this point I&#x27;m honestly not convinced that this is an economically solvable problem. It&#x27;s not sufficient to output more energy than you input either.<p>Let&#x27;s say a fusion reactor costs $1B to produce, has maintenance costs of $20m&#x2F;year and has a life of 50 years. That&#x27;s (at least) $2B you need to recover in capital costs from your &quot;free&quot; energy.<p>I honestly think burning a fuel of some sort will be here for a long, long time. I don&#x27;t want to discount the rising importance of wind and solar. I do believe that with the ever decreasing costs these will become even more important, even critical, in the future. They simply won&#x27;t completely replace some kind of combusted fuel.<p>Now what that fuel economy looks like is an unknown. There is a course a limit in what we can dig up out of the ground and to continue using it or something akin to it we need to solve the carbon problem. So what we really need is:<p>1. Some method of sequestering atmospheric carbon at scale; and<p>2. Some method of storing excess renewable energy.<p>There are multiple solutions to (2), the most common of which today seems to be using batteries. Current battery technology has come a long way but it has a lot of disadvantages, not the least of which is its current reliance on something that itself is limited (lithium). Plus obtaining all the materials for batteries seems to be highly environmentally destructive.<p>It&#x27;s unclear to me that without some major innovation batteries will only ever be a niche technology for the likes of a few Teslas and airplanes. Now I&#x27;m not saying that innovation won&#x27;t happen. I&#x27;m simply saying current battery tech isn&#x27;t there yet.<p>Another potential solution for (2) is to use energy to construct a fuel that can be transported and combusted eg [1].<p>Synthetic hydrocarbons have a lot of advantages. Convenience, relatively simple tech and high energy density (important for weight). Large scale carbon sequestration remains a huge sticking point however. Plus actual fossil fuels remain cheaper than synthetics but this will eventually change either because fossil fuels become much rarer or renewable energy costs get sufficiently low.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.quora.com&#x2F;How-do-I-get-gasoline-from-wind-power\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.quora.com&#x2F;How-do-I-get-gasoline-from-wind-power</a>","time":1493223415,"type":"comment"},{"by":"cowardlydragon","dead":true,"id":14213775,"parent":14202488,"text":"High energy neutrons makes LFTR&#x27;s issues with volatile chemicals degrading its pipes a child&#x27;s task ...<p>At least LFTR can be scaled down to &quot;cell&quot; sizes (the Oak Ridge reactor was slated as an perpetually flying aircraft powerplant) that can be regularly replaced&#x2F;recycled.

Contact them (or show up to their board meeting - tonight!) and ask them to build the high-housing version of the plan.<p>- The San Francisco Board of Supervisors is considering a plan to require 28% of all new developments to be below market rate. When you consider the unit costs to build in SF, that would make it _extremely_ difficult to justify new housing starts here.

(for more on this see carlaef.org)<p>- Call your CA State Senator and ask them to support SB 35 (would remove the ability of local government to block projects that meet certain criteria - near transit, have a high % of affordable units, use union construction labor)<p>- Email your VC&#x27;s and C-level executives and tell them how hard it is to find housing in the area and how ridiculous the parking requirements are. Tell them about your awful commutes and the difficulty of finding good school districts for your kids. Ask them to get more involved politically in pro-housing causes. Ron Conway is a good example here.<p>NIMBY&#x27;s are really well organized and things don&#x27;t change unless we do something about them.

(e) The teacher celebrates any academic success of the student with all members of the family and links this success to their efforts. (f) The teacher gives the student her phone number and tells the student to call with any questions about the homework - this gives the teacher the opportunity to find out in real-time if the student is going hungry at home, giving a deeper understanding of extent of the problem and perhaps allowing the teacher to tackle the problem in real-time.<p>Can such a teacher overcome the effects of poverty?<p>Here is a summary of a few studies as reported in Teaching as Leadership [1]:<p>&quot;The schools that are highly effective produce results that almost entirely overcome the effects of student background&quot; [2]<p>&quot;Having a top-quartile teacher rather than a bottom-quartile teacher four years in a row would be enough to close the black-white test score gap&quot; [3]<p>&quot;Differences in this magnitude -- 50 percentile points in just three years -- are stunning.

This is the first time I&#x27;m reading an article about teaching that actually makes the profession <i>more</i> attractive. I read a good amount about teaching but have never come across this. First time that I&#x27;m reading about proper teaching techniques in general, let alone Lemov&#x27;s taxonomy.<p>&gt; As Jane Hannaway, the director of the Education Policy Center at the Urban Institute and a former teacher, put it to me, successful teaching depends in part on a certain inimitable “voodoo.” You either have it or you don’t.<p>The idea that only a select group of individuals possessing a certain voodoo are capable of performing a certain task effectively is very pervasive. It also kills the desire to work on one&#x27;s approaches, learn new things, and otherwise develop skill. I would say it should be considered harmful, whether we&#x27;re talking about teachers or programmers...<p>&gt; They decided that rather than buy talent, they would try to build it.<p>It&#x27;s fairly rare to see anyone actually bother <i>building</i> talent. The expectation generally is that the person is either ready or useless.<p>&gt; Some teachers could regularly lift their students’ test scores above the average for children of the same race, class and ability level. Others’ students left with below-average results year after year.<p>This seems is not congruent with what I&#x27;ve been reading about teaching in the past few years: that student outcomes have mostly to do with the student&#x27;s aptitude, and that teachers have a limited effect[1].<p>Intuitively, I feel that teachers (and other environmental factors) &#x2F;should&#x2F; be able to have a large effect, and anecdotes about highly influential educators abound, yet other studies seem to make teachers look close to irrelevant compared to IQ.<p>Of course, these things are kind of related. The belief in the idea that you can train teachers implies that you should be able to train students.<p>&gt; Under her suggested compensation system, the city’s best teachers could earn as much as $130,000 a year.<p>Haven&#x27;t heard about this, either. Both myself and people I talk to continue to perceive teaching as a low paying profession. Given that the article is from 2010, perhaps those programs have died out by now.<p>Awarding high salaries only to amazing teachers may not be terribly productive, though, especially if the measure is not reliable and people don&#x27;t feel confident about it. Measuring teachers too much or too strictly causes all sorts of problems[2]. But I could scarcely imagine if teaching was overall perceived as a respected profession with a high salary ceiling and decent autonomy that it wouldn&#x27;t have a large community of people to work out something similar to Uncommon Schools. Correct incentives absolutely align people to solve problems.<p>A lot of the techniques seem like they could have more general application as communication skills. Communication and social skills are still one of those things that are perceived as &quot;voodoo&quot; and haven&#x27;t been documented terribly well.<p>&gt; Mathematicians need to understand a problem only for themselves; math teachers need both to know the math and to know how 30 different minds might understand (or misunderstand) it.<p>This point is one of the reasons I could never agree with the idea that if a person understands something, they can teach it.

Looked older than newsprint of the time.<p>Anyway, when I got to school it was easy to learn printing the blackboard way, and some of us then did cursive writing and were promoted to third grade at the end of the year.<p>So for the good part of a year I did cursive but before the next September they closed that school.<p>It was like getting a promotion but the employer still closes beyond your control before you can even get into duty.<p>Well instead I had to go to a place where they would only put me in second grade since they didn&#x27;t want me to be so much younger than the other kids.  They did not do any writing their first year and were just going to start printing with the big pencils.  There would be no cursive allowed until third grade so I went back to a year of printing instead of handwriting.  It was easy to see that conformity took precedence over advancement in such an institutional environment.  By the time I got to third grade I could already print faster than many adults could do longhand, I was not going back to my slow cursive, and I made it perfectly clear that I was already more advanced when I got there a year earlier.  Not an encouraging academic experience, but seemingly common.<p>It evolved into a form of fast printing eventually toward what looked like shorthand with hieroglyphics, not readable by others at all.  I still change fonts all the time.<p>There are no remaing samples of my actual handwriting.<p>So that&#x27;s why my handwriting sucks.  It doesn&#x27;t even exist any more.<p>However numbers need to be so unmistakeably readable when a lot is at stake, letters too but I start with numbers.<p>Naturally I used the same character (a straight line) for 1 and lower case L for the longest time, even though I had started with serifs on upper case i and thoroughly dotting my lower case i&#x27;s to avoid confusion.  Eventually all lower case L needs a little tail.  Turns out to be the lower case L is the one I could actually do without.  Gotta have numbers.<p>Basically, I encourage conscious calligraphy or &quot;lettering&quot; (drafting room or comic book style) in notebooks and documents.  In an international laboratory you really don&#x27;t want a trailing numeral 9 being confused for a lower case G meaning grams.\nWith cultures that cross their 7, consistency is important since often there is also an upstroke on the 1 which can throw those off who are unfamiliar.  Shortening the upstroke can be a good move but you want data recording to come naturally and not require conformity for its own sake.  I use an uncrossed 7 with a bold serif but not wild enough to ever be confused with a 9 myself.  4 must never be confused with A or 9, nor 8 with B, or 5 with S.  Zeros are good crossed when it might be helpful.  Stuff like that.  It must make sense.<p>I never want to make people feel like bureaucracy is more important than the characters they are working with.  Not a good feeling at all.<p>If your handwriting sucks because it&#x27;s difficult for others to read or decipher, then in that case consider it a special occasion and use calligraphy.","time":1493481613,"type":"comment"}],"parent":14220294,"text":"Instead of imrpoving my existing (sloppy but fast) handwriting I learned a secondary way to write that is much slower but very clear and easy to read.

The base of his problems seems to be that he writes with a mixture of different scripts, and if he taught himself to write with just one of them, he would be much better off.","time":1493403684,"type":"comment"},{"by":"robinson-wall","id":14220464,"kids":[{"by":"owlninja","id":14221080,"parent":14220464,"text":"I am ashamed to admit that it took a long time before I learned that sentence (with dog) is used because it has every letter of the alphabet.","time":1493398788,"type":"comment"},{"by":"libertymcateer","id":14221998,"parent":14220464,"text":"Yeah.

Now, getting good at something requires daily practice, for a long period of time during which one would rather not go around for hunting.

The date given for Californians according to this research is 130 000 year ago.<p>As far as I am aware, the earliest recorded human site outside of Africa is one in China 120 000 years ago.<p>And even that site is an outlier because human migration into the middle east began happening 120 000 -100 000 years ago, 60 000 years ago into Asia, and and  45 000 years into Europe.<p>Now that in itself is not conclusive, maybe there are older sites that we haven&#x27;t found and this discovery pushes back human migration.  Except there are other problems here.<p>LACK OF HUMAN REMAINS OR HUMAN ARTIFACTS<p>So the scientists say the rocks have markings that look like they had been used as a hammer and anvil and there are some mastodon bones near it.<p>Now no actual human bones were found near this site.  Which is certainly not impossible for these kinds of sites.  More problematic is that there were no obvious stone tools other than rocks with markings that look like they&#x27;d been hit.<p>With ancient humans, especially ones capable of hunting mastodons, you would expect them to make sharp stone points by flaking (hiting one stone against another).  This should leave flakes and tools on the ground.  Yet, at this site, there were no stone tools of this sort found anywhere at this site.<p>LACK OF CUT MARKINGS ON BONES<p>Further, once ancient humans killed the mastodon, you would expect them to cut pieces of flesh off with a stone knife so that it could be eaten.  This process would leave marks on the bones where the flesh had been cut.  The article tells us that no such markings were found on these bones.<p>&gt; Yet there were no cut marks on the bones showing that the animal was butchered for meat.<p>AVAILABILITY OF ALTERNATIVE EXPLANATIONS<p>None of these factors itself is fatal, but all three combined, the outlier date (way to early considering the mainstream evidence shows that our species were just getting set up in the middle east at this time,) the absence of human tools nearby, the absence of cut marks on the bones, the absence of any human skeletons or remains in the area.  All of these lead me to think there must be another explanation.<p>It&#x27;s not impossible that the bones of dead mastodons can get trampled or broken.  Under the right circumstances, it&#x27;s not impossible that trampling can cause rocks to smash against one another or leave marks on the rock.  Maybe there was a cliff in the area many years ago and the bones and the rocks took a deep fall.  In any event, there are alternative explanations and it is not inconceivable that this happened through natural means.  This is hardly smoking gun evidence of human in California 130 000 years ago.<p>USE OF WEAK EXPLANATORY MECHANISMS<p>And I think the weakness of this evidence is belied by the unusual explanatory leaps made by the discoverers.  When pointed out that there is no evidence that the remains had been butchered for meat, he responds:<p>&quot;The suggestion is that this site is strictly for breaking bone, to produce blank material, raw material to make bone tools or to extract marrow.&quot;  Seriously?  Why would they break bones without butchering the meat and eating it?  Why would you have a separate site just for bone marrow?  That makes no sense.<p>EVIDENCE THAT IS ANYTHING BUT CLEAR LABELED AS CLEAR<p>&gt;He says the rocks showed clear marks of having been used as hammers and an anvil.<p>Really, I mean they have pictures of the rocks on the site.  It doesn&#x27;t seem that clear to me that they were hammer and anvil stones.  Are they clear to anyone else?  They could just easily be old worn rocks.   I would expect humans that could make it from Africa or wherever all the way to California 130 000 years ago to be somewhat advanced enough that they have tools more advanced than just two random pieces of rock to bang together. This was the age where humans had started molding rocks for suited purposes by flaking them.  Why they would just use two natural rocks instead of created rocks is questionable.  If you type in acheulean tools into google, you can see the sophisticated flaked tools (sharp looking leaf shaped blades) our ancestors were making 1.7 million years ago . . . yet ones that traveled all the way to California and kill mastodons are still stuck banging random un-molded rocks against each other for marrow- why?<p>I have nothing against pushing back migration to Americas, but this site is probably more wishful thinking on part of its founders than legitimate discovery.","time":1493260871,"type":"comment"},{"by":"xHopen","id":14210281,"parent":14204939,"text":"<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goodreads.com&#x2F;book&#x2F;show&#x2F;13166597-beyond-the-blue-horizon\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goodreads.com&#x2F;book&#x2F;show&#x2F;13166597-beyond-the-blue-...</a>","time":1493285941,"type":"comment"},{"by":"WalterBright","id":14205568,"kids":[{"by":"canjobear","id":14205686,"kids":[{"by":"WalterBright","id":14206177,"parent":14205686,"text":"The text and the pictures are confusing - the picture shows haplogroup X having a european origin, and the text says otherwise.","time":1493234895,"type":"comment"}],"parent":14205568,"text":"That is the &quot;Solutrean Hypothesis&quot;: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Solutrean_hypothesis\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Solutrean_hypothesis</a><p>My understanding is that it is roundly rejected by almost all archaeologists.","time":1493231601,"type":"comment"},{"by":"enceladus_ice","id":14206783,"kids":[{"by":"flukus","id":14208830,"kids":[{"by":"enceladus_ice","id":14209075,"parent":14208830,"text":"Yep, the article is talking about a group of people that are definitely pre-Clovis, which is super exciting!<p>I was replying to WalterBright&#x27;s comment mentioning the Clovis culture coming from what is now Europe.","time":1493265554,"type":"comment"}],"parent":14206783,"text":"&gt; Geneticists sequenced the DNA from a young boy&#x27;s 13,000-year-old bones found in Montana.<p>Wouldn&#x27;t that make the boy a member of the clovis culture and not the pre-clovis one being discussed?","time":1493261611,"type":"comment"},{"by":"red_hairing","id":14207294,"kids":[{"by":"Steko","id":14208568,"parent":14207294,"text":"If you&#x27;re going to object to their science, let&#x27;s hear the actual objections and not just handwavey notions that somehow the science is bad because you don&#x27;t favor the conclusions.","time":1493257457,"type":"comment"},{"by":"enceladus_ice","id":14209057,"parent":14207294,"text":"Which political considerations are you talking about?","time":1493265283,"type":"comment"}],"parent":14206783,"text":"but given political considerations, can that particular science be trusted?","time":1493242912,"type":"comment"}],"parent":14205568,"text":"I recently watched a NOVA documentary from last year that refutes the Eurocentric theories of Clovis origins.<p>Great Human Odyssey: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pbs.org&#x2F;video&#x2F;2365856257&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pbs.org&#x2F;video&#x2F;2365856257&#x2F;</a><p>Geneticists sequenced the DNA from a young boy&#x27;s 13,000-year-old bones found in Montana.

We had libraries in all the languages we were using (php, node js, go, python, c &#x2F; c++) that followed the convention.<p>The convention was simple.  Every log MUST have at least these three parameters: --action, --r, and --t, and one optional one: --p.<p>--action would be the &quot;subject&quot; of the message with a dot notation.  A lot of times it&#x27;s simply class.method or class.method.something.finished.<p>--r is the &quot;request&quot; hash.  This hash represented everything that has happened in the current process to handle whatever was asked of it.  So for a web request, the --r would start as the request came in from nginx, and the --r would end when the response was sent back.<p>--t is the &quot;thread&quot; hash.  If the calling process sent a --t parameter, use that.  Otherwise, generate a new one.<p>--p is the &quot;parent&quot; hash.  If the calling process sent a --r parameter, set that as --p.  Otherwise, don&#x27;t add it.<p>All of this was automated in the logging libraries.  So generally a developer would simply call Log.d(&#x27;whatever&#x27;, {something: &#x27;something something&#x27;}) or Log::d(&#x27;whatever&#x27;, [&#x27;something&#x27;, &#x27;something else&#x27;]);<p>Requiring those four params allows us a couple fantastic things.  First, highlighting the --action field made it a lot like looking at your inbox.  Every message had a subject;  This made for very simple skimming.  Second, when hunting errors, it was very easy to find all the other related log messages by searching for the matching --r(equest) value.  Third, for larger processes that sometimes involved tens of servers, it was easy to generate a tree of the entire request from start to finish, by simply using the --t(hread), --p(arent), and --r(equest) values.<p>These logs were all sent to rsyslog, which forwarded all logs to a central server (Also running rsyslog), which kept up beautifully.  Besides handling the collection and transport for us, it was great to be able to watch the logs centrally - and then on each server when necessary - just by tailing &#x2F;var&#x2F;log&#x2F;syslog.  I had written a couple parsers for our logs on the central server, but eventually, as the project grew, our logs became far too much to handle with simple tailing apps, so we went with ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).<p>Back then we used Logstash for the conversion, but on recent projects, I&#x27;ve just used rsyslog&#x27;s @cee plugin, which skips the &quot;L&quot;.<p>And, over time, we&#x27;d added a few more indices that worked well with kibana dashboards and tables.  The two most useful were --i and --ms.<p>An --i parameter was simply an incrementing int starting at 0 for every new --r(equest hash).  Lots of times our logs came in out of order, so having an explicit incrementing value in the log messages was really handy.   An --ms parameter was for milliseconds.  Any log message that had timed something included an --ms message.  That was most excellent for dashboards.<p>Also, all hashes were simply truncated SHA1 hashes.  For instance, on the API server, we explicitly took the server IP, request URI, headers, parameters and a timestamp (to the ms), hashed it, and truncated to 12 chars.  Any collisions were generally spread out apart enough in time that they weren&#x27;t an issue.","time":1493286660,"type":"comment"},{"by":"Rodders7884","dead":true,"id":14210030,"parent":14209168,"text":"If folks want a fancy format they can always use AWK to reformat the beautifully readable developer logs.

Someone totally new to beziers wouldn&#x27;t know where to start making the distinction for which sections apply to them and give up entirely.<p>My suggestion is, think you could create an &quot;applications of beziers&quot; page which lists common bezier use cases? eg. Draw a curved path. Animate using easing. Animate along a curve. Animate along a curve with an ease. Then link from there to only to the sections you&#x27;d need to learn and apply to get to that application? It would be infinitely more helpful to new learners.<p>The Primer would then remain a great resource as a standalone. And the Applications page would be a great navigation and learning resource page for people looking to start.","time":1493139996,"type":"comment"},{"by":"spi","id":14198028,"kids":[{"by":"TheRealPomax","id":14198813,"parent":14198028,"text":"This depends on which definitions you work with.

If you insist on being fancy, you can say that the i-th term in the sum is the probability of a discrete random variable X with binomial law being equal to i, so the sum over all i must be 1 (here the binomial law has parameters (n,t)).<p>By the way, this last thing has the nice interpretation that each point of the Bézier curve is just the expected value of $p(X)$, where $p(0), \\dots, p(n)$ are the points you are interpolating - by changing t you are just changing the parameter of the random variable.","time":1493154459,"type":"comment"},{"by":"klunger","id":14209925,"kids":[{"by":"TheRealPomax","id":14213024,"parent":14209925,"text":"Aw, that&#x27;s awesome.

I&#x27;ve long been enthusiastic about TypeScript especially, but from a distance, unable to allocate time to take it seriously enough.<p>I think the state of js and environment is now at a point that, in my view at least, I should not begin the smallest project without a deep dive into the state of the language.  I see things moving so fast, that - at least in my workplace where we&#x27;ve had teams stick together for years commonly (partnership!) - it would suck to find oneself misdirected by a aggressive assumption, or find oneself in a unloved cul - de - sac of dependencies.<p>Tl;dr js is IMO at a place where the pay off for deeply studying the state of the language, is substantial while risk of not deeply groking js are rising fast.<p>Personally, I think I shall better resort to getting a new shelf of good books, for my needs, but I do believe the risk reward is looking hairy for any casual users.

I have no need, but I&#x27;m just displaying my age when I note that visually my mind thinks of early Netscape view source spelunking and text editors, not a actual IDE and build system.<p>What keeps me, well into a fourth decade of programming, from using JavaScript I think is only the fact that I totally phase out at the state of the tool chain for js. My mind blanks. But there&#x27;s so much to like, using js, that i hope it&#x27;s not abandoned by time I get to really learning it.

This is a tautology and will be one until the climate starts killing swaths of people, which may take decades to set in.<p>Therefore, the people and the ignorance are the wrong thing to focus on. If you convince one person, there are going to be ten more people born in that time of such low socioeconomic status that your arguments that convinced the one will fall on deaf ears for the other ten. What you must focus on is making climate-friendly actions profitable and desirable. I am going to leave a link to a comment I made previously if you like what I&#x27;m saying so far.<p>Basically, forget people. They are not going to care, and even if you convince all Americans, how will you convince China, India, Africa, etc? The answer is that you won&#x27;t. I repeat, forget about the people.<p>Here[1] is my old comment that discusses this in greater detail. Also, feel free to reply with some strawman rebuttal of this; you won&#x27;t get the satisfaction of a reply from me, I&#x27;ve seen way too much negativity on this site (see the comments of the boring company video) to possibly care about  contributing to some argument with reality-detached software engineers.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=14175468\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=14175468</a>","time":1493442682,"type":"comment"},{"by":"blitmap","id":14225159,"parent":14225126,"text":"Build a dome.
