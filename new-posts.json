Especially from the POV of an employee.<p>Having worked at only smaller companies (the largest I&#x27;ve worked at has 200 employees, only about 20 that are in IT and programming), and that do not have a numbering system for their employee ranks, it&#x27;s a bit difficult for me to grasp how division of tasks is administered in the large tech companies.<p>For example, the very early Facebook and the one today are a world of difference. When they started, the tech side really was mostly coding PHP and the front end, and routine web host maintenance (from a third party service if they are really starting out). This is the kind of company I&#x27;m most familiar with. I am accustomed to building websites or apps for smaller clients that have small customer bases.<p>But today&#x27;s Facebook is very different. They hire much more than web devs for their tech departments. I have no idea how they are organized internally, and trying to guess the hierarchy is way over my head.

My current job is not bad and the technologies I work are current and emerging ones. I do actively spend time keeping tab on changing trends, and to keep pace with them. But I feel that my learning is shallow. Though I get a hang of new things I am not able to devote enough time (job&#x2F;family commitments, commute etc.) to focus and develop depth in some of the areas I am interested in.<p>With an intent of improving my tech chops I am thinking of a taking a break of around ~6 months (leave the current job and look for a new one after ~6 months).<p>During this period I plan to improve my tech skills with focus towards distributed systems. At the end of my break I look forward to work in\ndeveloping solutions that involve distributed systems or work in setup, management, and monitoring of complex distributed systems (dev OPS role).<p>Here is a list of things I intend to focus during my break:<p><pre><code>  -- refresh&#x2F;study datastructures, algorithms\n  -- learn a new programming language (thinking of Go, Rust)\n  -- learn a functional programming language (thinking of Erlang, or Haskell)\n  -- contribute to an open source project (currently I don&#x27;t have any list&#x2F;idea about ones I can look at)\n  -- get familiar with *nix internals\n  -- get a basic understanding of web security\n  -- A few MOOCs here and there\n  -- Read SICP (and similar texts). </code></pre>\n(I am skeptical about SICP goal as I don&#x27;t have a reading group to discuss things I study. I am afraid that reading alone with no discussion&#x2F;feedback I  will fall into the trap thinking that I have understood the topic despite gaps in my understanding.)<p>Given my intent I am requesting suggestions from HNers about the best possible ways to make effective use of the break I am planning for. Any other related suggestions are most welcome.<p>PS: I am currently based out of Bangalore<p>Thanks in advance.","time":1493482740,"title":"Ask HN: How to best utilize a 6 months sabbatical to
