Look at where we are now and how we came here.<p>Back in the non-ajax days we used to do them all on the server side, then render the whole page all in one go. This would have come in handy back then! Imagine doing 5x 50ms queries asynchronously, dropping a 250ms response delay down to 50ms! But this stuff was hard back then, and we mostly left it alone.<p>This is also along the times when we figured out that since we <i>can</i> have pages that take a long time to load and block the interpreter, perhaps it&#x27;s not such a great idea to serve many requests with a single interpreter, so people started using stuff like nginx to run multiple python interpreters in parallel (not even getting into threads here), which was easier to reason about since each python process is a separate universe that can block entirely, but overall we can still serve a new request with a new interpreter, so for the most part things are good.<p>Then the twisted people thought that this was silly, and why should we block in the first place, and they decided that the way to fix this was to change the way we program entirely, and re-create or wrap an entire ecosystem of software. It sort of worked, except there wasn&#x27;t a good twisted package for your thing. But all in all it worked.<p>Then the greenlets (or one of its other 20 names) people came and wanted to instead use fine-grained implicit concurrency, and said &quot;no no, we can get something with nicer abstraction packaging while mostly not changing the code we have&quot;, and that was even nicer, except when something didn&#x27;t get monkey patched correctly for some reason. We got stuff like gunicorn, which was impressive.<p>Then as we moved more stuff to the client to create more responsive (in the original meaning of the word) applications, so we pushed the burden of requesting and fetching data to the browser side, which means that as a page loads, it might call REST APIs one by one (hopefully asynchronously!), each of which might make a single (finer-grained) database or service call behind the scenes.<p>So how different is this now from the gunicorn model? In the latter, you get fine threads of control, each working asynchronously to fetch their own thing, which gets put together in the server side, and then sent back to the client. In the former, you get similarly fine threads of control, but the fine threads perhaps live in their own universes, and it doesn&#x27;t get all put back together until it travels over the internet to the browser.<p>So it&#x27;s a little bit different, but overall what&#x27;s happening is similar. It feels like we just keep moving concerns and procedures up and down the stack.<p>Surely there&#x27;s reasons for all this. Times and technologies change, and we find ways to adapt. I like the &quot;async&quot; stuff because it makes things explicit. It&#x27;s the middle-ground result of the culmination of our learnings that hiding async behavior makes libraries hard to design and can result in frustrating and unpredictable behavior, whilst changing the entire programming model isn&#x27;t great either.

If it computes at all, it only computes being-a-rock.<p>This rock analogy is the sort of sloppy thinking that takes someone from &quot;it takes at least 38 petaflops to simulate a conscious human brain&quot; (currently unknown, but not <i>obviously</i> incorrect) to &quot;the human brain is a petaflop-class supercomputer&quot; (WTF, no, category error).","time":1493413623,"type":"comment"}],"parent":14218013,"text":"Fascinating analysis!  \nThe section &quot;Building devices that approach physical limits&quot; reminds me of a rock Kurzweil mentions in &quot;The Singularity is Near&quot; [1].

To appreciate the feasibility of computing with no energy and no heat, consider the computation that takes place in an ordinary rock. Although it may appear that nothing much is going on inside a rock, the approximately 1025 (ten trillion trillion) atoms in a kilogram of matter are actually extremely active. Despite the apparent solidity of the object, the atoms are all in motion, sharing electrons back and forth, changing particle spins, and generating rapidly moving electromagnetic fields. All of this activity represents computation, even if not very meaningfully organized. We’ve already shown that atoms can store information at a density of greater than one bit per atom, such as in computing systems built from nuclear magnetic-resonance devices. University of Oklahoma researchers stored 1,024 bits in the magnetic interactions of the protons of a single molecule containing nineteen hydrogen atoms.51 Thus, the state of the rock at any one moment represents at least 1027 bits of memory.”<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goodreads.com&#x2F;quotes&#x2F;1284270-how-smart-is-a-rock-to-appreciate-the-feasibility-of\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goodreads.com&#x2F;quotes&#x2F;1284270-how-smart-is-a-rock...</a>","time":1493409232,"type":"comment"},{"by":"kangxitenant","id":14223175,"parent":14218013,"text":"<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;1301.4504\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;1301.4504</a>\nquantum computation complexity prevents hawking radiation from being decoded before the black hole evaporates!","time":1493414647,"type":"comment"},{"by":"prashnts","id":14222263,"kids":[{"by":"projectorlochsa","id":14222494,"parent":14222263,"text":"I remember watching some documentaries and reading some articles, and remember Hugo de Garis talking about femtotech.

I could grok service component jars (as in SCA) with service description artifacts and manifests, but OSGI, making its way from a modular Java spec for mobile apps (J2ME anyone?) to a general-purpose server module thingy and service container was too much a projection surface for everything and anything for me.

Quite the opposite: these questions simply force people to share more information than they should be <i>required</i> to share, and (for most people who don’t think to lie) it increases the chance that sensitive secrets will be revealed and used to impersonate people.<p>It’s even worse when these “security” questions are coupled with the “Monday-Friday, 9-5 ET” phone numbers.

My idea was not to reprint HN save as a cutaway box, maybe with 2d barcode links, to provide context for the written article that takes survey of, e.g. HN as a measure.<p>The value to the reader, is that by showing the original thoughts &amp; debate, the reader can clearly see they are not receiving stale material, bounded by the three to six months print magazine lead time.<p>My editorial approach is to build ground up. Top down is the publishing (and programming) tradition: Plan, project, design, assign, assemble. But HackerDigest&#x27;s approach i would be a clean slate, monthly: Follow discussions, cross reference trends, back check technical factors in the debates, especially not overlooking edge cases; compile overview; write synopsis; commission to journalists who can turn around fast, alongside seeking major vendor comment (something that would help drive advertising pitches) and publish.<p>I&#x27;d love to read your work, but I&#x27;m on mobile this holiday weekend so will probably have to wait until I&#x27;m home.

I don&#x27;t know how hard it is to get good writers to forgo byline at least..but certainly that newspaper can.) Or as a ghost, more frequently for advertorials under a CxO&#x27;s name.<p>I think my proximity to the profit centers in publishing, helps massively. I started in publishing, because in 1993, a fast growing stock market darling, had no sales who understood what multimedia was, so I got hired with almost a &quot;start now&quot; exhortation. I started next working day.<p>I say that, because -- at least in print -- I learned the financial constraints quickly (befriended by a ex PwC fellow who quit partner track off a first class math degree, because he rightly identified the optimization opportunity in print media, set against internet threat)<p>So I was first published when the pagination left space spare, and a advertiser who I had sold by comparing how their tech worked vs a forthcoming competitor ipo, and got their ceo to take the space if we could turn around advertorial fast enough to meet copy date. They already had display adverts, so this was the only thing that made sense.<p>As you know, highlighted even, possibly, by Medium, the economics of writing for online journals, is radically different.<p>Despite this, print has not - trade journal claims are misleading - fallen as significantly as you may believe. Traded forward, print ads in magazines, discounts to a $TLN market. I help super verticals,and trade association titles, discover sell side alpha. Why the trade press dismisses the print market, is a combination of traditional buy side monopolism, and the online advertising business lately being described by the outgoing CEO of Mediacom, as &quot;criminal&quot;, no qualifications of that word.","time":1493593948,"type":"comment"}],"parent":14215385,"text":"I&#x27;m a top Writer on Medium for Music and Social Media.

From what I&#x27;ve heard Teller has only delivered this talk in a few unrecorded keynotes over the years and I&#x27;m still grateful I managed to get a front and center seat for this talk.<p>In the talk, Teller walked through the entire history of a single trick from both directions: his history in finding and learning about the trick, and the history of the trick&#x27;s development and evolution from magician to magician.<p>An interesting takeaway is the interesting frisson between the need of magicians to be public figures and broadly advertise (and televise) and yet their need for some secrecy in the details of their work. You can often see the evolution of a trick across advertisements and filmed portrayals of a trick: they are open secrets of a sort, because magicians want an audience. Few professions are so deeply secretive and yet so deeply and publicly documented.<p>The biggest takeaway, though, was a deeper appreciation for the skill often required to learn a trick, the incredible amount of dexterity and practice required until you can make it look easy, until you can make it look magic. That you can know the entire history of a trick and every detail of how it was performed and not accomplish that trick without years and years of practice.<p>Teller stated his hypothesis of that talk was that for some tricks, knowing how it is accomplished and seeing a trick decomposed into component parts doesn&#x27;t lose all of the magic from a trick because you get the corresponding magic of that appreciation of the skill and timing and dexterity needed to pull it off, to run through all of the parts in quick enough succession.<p>That&#x27;s something that you can see Penn &amp; Teller often play with in their act, revealing the components of an illusion explicitly, just before or just after combining them in thrilling ways at a full pace. That continues to marvel even knowing everything about how it is done.<p>I often wonder if Penn &amp; Teller sometimes think the magic field is too secretive for its own good. I think it&#x27;s interesting how much in their act they seem to imply that the best magic is the magic where you know what is going on and it is still magic to watch; that it is not the secrets of magic that make it compelling to watch but the human skills of elocution and drama and timing and dexterity.<p>ETA: Obviously a lot of the talk I saw is a little more coldly direct in the article here than as I saw it presented, but I felt like waxing poetic on the same subject.","time":1493309397,"type":"comment"},{"by":"jonknee","id":14213296,"kids":[{"by":"baby","id":14213452,"kids":[{"by":"jonknee","id":14214788,"kids":[{"by":"baby","id":14218598,"parent":14214788,"text":"Thanks for posting that!

The key thing to understand is that whilst the software industry has done a good job of automating and improving <i>intra</i>-business work, through things like office and enterprise software, it&#x27;s had relatively little impact on <i>inter</i>-business work, which is still mostly paper based. Even when workflows are theoretically digitised, it&#x27;s often simply by sending scans of paper forms or Word&#x2F;PDF files via email. There are exceptions in the travel and financial industries (with SABRE and SWIFT respectively), but those are relatively restricted networks - for instance I doubt Google or its suppliers are directly connected to SWIFT.<p>There&#x27;s some low hanging fruit. Email has DKIM and DMARC. Deploying these widely would make the From header reliable, at least assuming unhacked machines. It isn&#x27;t intuitive that the From header can&#x27;t be trusted and office workers typically assume that it is ... after all, it&#x27;s <i>normally</i> correct and why would something as critical as email allow anyone to impersonate anyone else? But by default, it does.<p>Unfortunately DMARC is a fairly recent standard and the email space is quite stagnant, so many organisations don&#x27;t use it, making email-based phishing trivial. It also hits the problem that lots of organisations have developed insecure mail practices over time in which impersonation is common, like marketing firms that send email on another organisations behalf, so deploying DMARC isn&#x27;t as simple as just switching it on. It can often take months to track down and fix all the mail being sent with a &quot;From: someone@foo.org&quot; header but which actually wasn&#x27;t sent by foo.org servers. That means it&#x27;s a project that needs a budget, and that in turn means it often doesn&#x27;t get proposed or worked on. Especially because the victims of email phishing are typically <i>other</i> companies, not the company being impersonated.<p>But because DKIM and DMARC are fundamentally based on digital signatures, and because the workflows being attacked are so often email based, setting up DKIM&#x2F;DMARC is one of the best practical ways to secure modern business.<p>Now ... longer term, email with Word documents attached is not a solid base on which to link businesses together, DKIM&#x2F;DMARC or not. It&#x27;s hard to automate. It&#x27;s very susceptible to human error. It suffers strange limitations, like tiny attachment sizes. Organisations often mutilate it, like with mandatory headers&#x2F;footer legal disclaimers that are larger than the messages itself, or with vacation responders that don&#x27;t understand mailing lists. And as nobody really coordinates or is responsible for the email network, nobody is incentivised to improve it. When improvements happen, they happen slowly and mostly because Google or Yahoo employees made it happen through sheer force of will.<p>Corda is an open source project that is trying to build a new inter-business network, focused (for now) on finance. So things like invoicing and bill paying is very much in scope. It uses digital signatures and encryption pervasively from the start. It takes a lot of inspiration from Bitcoin and the block chain space, although it does not use chains of blocks or proof of work itself. Some of what it does is focused on building a kind of shared global database, albeit one with rather different properties to a normal database, but part of what it does is make it easy to build structured workflows between firms using straight-line blocking code that resembles a written English description of the process. So there&#x27;s plans to support human interaction in these workflows, but ultimately, the goal is to try and get them off email and paper based processes and onto something more secure and more structured.

If there is a power outage while I am at work, I can find out when it started and how long it lasted from the security system logs, which log both power out and power back events. Before, I could figure out when power came back from my digital clocks that reset to 12:00 when power comes on. I could improve this if I added an electric analog clock, since in a power outage that would not reset but it would stop ticking. The amount of time the analog clock was behind would then tell the total time power was out, and the digital clock would tell how long ago power came on. That would not tell me if there was a single outage, or multiple outages. It would be fairly easy to build a gizmo specifically for that: analog electric clock hooked up through a relay in such a way that if it loses power, it does not come back on until you press a reset button. That clock would then record the time the first outage started. From that, the time power came back on for the last time (found via the digital clock), and the total outage duration (from the other analog electric clock), one could figure out if there had been a single outage or multiple outages.<p>2.

I&#x27;ve done my fair share of LSD some years ago, but to me (to lift a simile from somebody else), it&#x27;s a bit like a program&#x27;s coredump. All the information is there, sure, less pre-categorized &#x2F; pre-filtered, but it&#x27;s not exactly guiding, so to speak. You&#x27;re left on your own in a forest. Not always, and doesn&#x27;t have to be like that, but I&#x27;ve seen diminishing returns after a while (meaning, it definitely does give you something the first time; and perhaps several more - when you can focus on thoughts and the world in a calmer way). The latter may not even be the case for some people, maybe, but I definitely think there is an overall &quot;floor&quot; in regards to the &quot;depth&quot; you can reach. Let me compare and contrast.<p>This may sound cheesy, but the quoted text above reminds me very much of Kant and the approach he had laid out in his <i>Critique of Pure Reason</i>, which I very much recommend and had the pleasure to (to a most definitely quite limited degree) grok, partly. (I think it&#x27;s quite possible to just take it and read it - some guidance would definitely help - but in itself, it&#x27;s very organized and (when he&#x27;s not contradicting himself, which (under some interpretations) does happen) almost pedagogical at times. Familiarity with (especially) Hume and (perhaps) Leibniz, et al. would help, but I think there&#x27;s value to be extraced by reading it just like that.)<p>In epistemology (&quot;how do we come to know things, and what kinds of things can we know?&quot;), Kant was all about the &quot;Kantian filter&#x2F;net&quot; - the &quot;raw experience&quot; &#x2F; sense data we get is not actually raw; not only is it filtered just by virtue of us having specific perceptual sense, but there appears to be structure in the very experience we get (for him, this was (first and foremost) spatial, temporal and causal structure; in addition to this, we have an arsenal of Kantian <i>categories</i>, which are something that all objects we get to experience have, our perception applying the former to the latter involuntarily and preemptively; Kantian categories are (so to speak) &quot;conditions of the possibility of objects in the first place&quot;). Kant goes into detail about this, attempting to deduce them and the associated &quot;judgments&quot; (we judge whenever we understand things, for him), and so on. His whole project does a reversal of the &quot;how can we know laws of the world?&quot; inductive approach done by Hume et al.; it&#x27;s not <i>observed temporal sequences</i> -&gt; <i>causal relations between events</i> -&gt; aha! - <i>general causal principle</i>. Kant instead reverses the &quot;direction&quot; and shows how you inevitably have to have a general causal principle <i>if you are to have any experience whatsoever</i> (this is explain in part in his <i>Second Analogy</i>, for anyone interested). Thus it is that even though we cannot know how things in the world are &quot;in themselves&quot;, we know <i>things about our experience</i> - their <i>conditions</i>. Consider a fish: a &quot;normal&quot; thinking fish would just think that all its world is water. But a Kantian fish would deduce that even though it does not know what the world &quot;out there&quot; truly is, whether it&#x27;s water, not-water-deceiving-as-water, or a mixture - it can know something - namely: whatever it comes to experience, the experience itself is <i>aquatic</i> so to speak, having to come &quot;through water&quot;. Kant applies this general approach to a number of things, going in detail about the &quot;filters&quot; and about what they tell us about the world, and how this can be used to revive metaphysics (which aims to know what things exist in the world <i>a priori</i> (known not empirically); no, we cannot know this, in a sense; but we can pin down the conditions of human experience, at the very least; these conditions will be <i>a priori</i>).<p><i>This</i> kind of stuff was (in a way) quite more powerful than the &quot;knowledge&quot; from LSD. LSD is good for other things, and it can &quot;bootstrap&quot; your drive for knowledge (maybe), and give you initial insights.

These patterns and tapes laid down in our consciousness are walled off from each other. I see it as a vast labyrinth with high walls sealing off the many directives created by our personal history.<p>Many of these directives are contradictory. The coexistence of these contradictory programs is what we call inner conflict. This conflict causes us to constantly check ourselves while we are caught in the opposition of polarity. Another metaphor would be like a computer with many programs running simultaneously. The more programs that are running, the slower the computer functions. This is a problem then. With all the programs running that are demanded of our consciousness in this modern world, we have problems finding deep integration.<p>To complicate matters, the programs are reinforced by fear. Fear separates, love integrates. We find ourselves drawn to love and unity, but afraid to make the leap.<p>What I found to be the genius of LSD is that it really gets you high, higher than the programs, higher than the walls that mask and blind one to the energy destroying presence of many contradictory but hidden programs. When LSD is used intentionally it enables you to see all the tracks laid down, to explore each one intensely. It also allows you to see the many parallel and redundant programs as well as the contradictory ones.<p>It allows you to see the underlying unity of all opposites in the magic play of existence. This allows you to edit these programs and recreate superior programs that give you the insight to shake loose the restrictions and conflicts programmed into each one of us by our parents, our religion, our early education, and by society as a whole.</i><p>---<p>Very much in line with what recent neuroscience results are finding:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;srep46421\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;srep46421</a><p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;brain-scans-reveal-how-lsd-affects-consciousness-1.19727\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;brain-scans-reveal-how-lsd-affect...</a>","time":1493330582,"type":"comment"},{"by":"ShannonAlther","id":14216069,"kids":[{"by":"eip","id":14216566,"parent":14216069,"text":"&quot;According to court testimony, Pickard&#x27;s lab produced up to a kilogram of LSD approximately every five weeks for short periods.

A very useful thing to know is that what we experience as reality is basically just one view of the underlying data from a set of sensors (our senses), there&#x27;s a neural net with multiple layers that starts with simple things like edge detection or whatever and builds up the 3D model we consciously experience from a mix of the external data, but also internal data, etc., there&#x27;s no right or wrong view of this data, we could have evolved to experience it completely different and we can make computer program to visualize data in numerous different ways and on psychedelics you can experience things a bit differently from what you&#x27;re used to. The reason it&#x27;s useful to know some of this is because if you experience something strange when doing psychedelics, you&#x27;ll know you&#x27;re not being kidnapped by aliens, going insane, talking to god or whatever weird thing that some people sometimes seem to think.","time":1493376524,"type":"comment"},{"by":"soundwave106","id":14219895,"kids":[{"by":"soineuh","id":14225273,"kids":[{"by":"soundwave106","id":14228690,"parent":14225273,"text":"Although there are a lot of unknowns (and I&#x27;d fully respect that sort of opinion), comparing a primarily-5HT2A agonist to a bullet in the brain seems wildly exaggerated given the current evidence I know.

Or not.<p>Anyway, I simply asserted that the claim to know an experience, before having that experience, is absurd. I&#x27;m pointing to the distinction between knowing something, subjectively, as opposed to knowing about it, objectively. That&#x27;s just a fact.<p>Consider a less contentious example.

Many philosophers use the term “subjective knowledge” to refer only to knowledge of one’s own subjective states. Such knowledge is distinguished from one’s knowledge of another individual’s subjective states and from knowledge of objective reality, which would both be objective knowledge under the present definitions. Your knowledge of another person’s subjective states can be called objective knowledge since it is presumably part of the world that is “object” for you, just as you and your subjective states are part of the world that is “object” for the other person.<p>&gt; This is a prominent distinction in epistemology (the philosophical study of knowledge) because many philosophers have maintained that subjective knowledge in this sense has a special status. They assert, roughly, that knowledge of one’s own subjective states is direct, or immediate, in a way that knowledge of anything else is not. It is convenient to refer to knowledge of one’s own subjective states simply as subjective knowledge. Following this definition, objective knowledge would be knowledge of anything other than one’s own subjective states.<p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.iep.utm.edu&#x2F;objectiv&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.iep.utm.edu&#x2F;objectiv&#x2F;</a>","time":1493500488,"type":"comment"}],"parent":14225391,"text":"I know everything anybody needs to know about it and more.

They might not have known about germs but they did draw the correlation between uncooked vegetables and being ill.","time":1493235809,"type":"comment"},{"by":"gurkendoktor","id":14206276,"kids":[{"by":"Banthum","id":14206388,"kids":[{"by":"Laforet","id":14208473,"kids":[{"by":"lacampbell","id":14208738,"kids":[{"by":"Laforet","id":14208823,"kids":[{"by":"lacampbell","id":14208863,"parent":14208823,"text":"I&#x27;ve never heard anyone complain about that stuff in Taipei the same way they complain about it in Mainland cities.

Thus rearing young children is not unlike taming a wild animal and a lot of nasty things kids do can be forgiven on the basis that they have not learned the proper way to act yet.<p>The ugly side of this thinking is that this naturally restricts youth rights since they are saw as an extension of the will of their parents; indeed one can argue that children are never fully independent until the death of their parents absolves them of these control and responsibilities. On the other hand, Confucianism has always been ambivalent if not indifferent to topics very touchy in the Judeo-Christian tradition such as abortion and infanticide, because the victims have not had a chance to develop their personhood yet, and thus these acts are sometimes considered deplorable but never compared to murder.","time":1493262237,"type":"comment"}],"parent":14208473,"text":"Living in China I&#x27;ve noticed that the attitude towards the very young does seem really similar to the attitude they have towards their pets.

Even urine-soaked earth dug up in alleys can be sold as a source of nitrates.<p>A second and more ingrained reason is that young children are regarded to only have the intelligence of animals because you cannot reason with them like how pre-Christianity Romans thought, thus they are to be treated with the same level of respect that animals deserve: if kids want to relieve themselves, then it might as well happen on the spot because self-control is beyond their facilities.<p>Shanghai is also unusual among major Chinese cities that many households in the old town are not serviced by sewage lines. Instead everybody bought their nightly waste to public septic tanks and pour it down a chute before a vacumm truck takes the load away every few weeks.

I live in the US, in NY, 70 miles north of Wall Street, in a house with two bathtubs, four sinks, three toilets, one washing machine, and one dish washer, with nearly no use of &quot;sewer pipes&quot;.  Right, no city sewer.  Instead there is some PVC pipe, cheap, super simple to work with, darned rugged, and, presto, bingo, a big concrete box in the ground just behind the main piece of big, white PVC pipe.  That box is the septic tank.  It&#x27;s been working great, with essentially zero maintenance, for 20+ years.<p>So, all the water used in the house, from the toilets, sinks, etc. is collected via PVC pipe and fed into the septic tank.  The water from the septic tank flows into a &quot;drain field&quot; in the back yard.<p>Works great.<p>With the septic tank, there\nwas only one problem only once:  I had an infection on the edge of the nail on my left big toe and daily applied triple antibiotic cream (eventually cleared up the infection).  Soon I had water, etc. bubbling up near the back of the back yard.<p>Why?  The antibiotic cream was powerful stuff; some of it got on my socks; when I washed the socks in the washing machine, some of the cream got into the septic tank and basically killed off the crucial bacteria that was eating everything not just H2O (right, and creating CO2 and methane which bubbled out, rarely noticeable).<p>Solution?  Sure, the grocery store sells a box of little, dry granules.  So, flush about half of the box down any one of the toilets.  Then the bacteria in the septic tank are alive and working again; the spot in the backyard dried up again, and no more problems!<p>Just need a septic tank, a little PVC pipe, and no sewer pipe or sewer treatment plant, etc.<p>For water, nope, I get nothing from the city.  Instead I have a well.  Well, the septic tank is in the back yard and the well, in the front yard -- not sure that makes much difference since the well is deep enough, likely 100+ feet, not to use &quot;surface water&quot;.<p>So, how do I get &quot;pure water&quot;?  Hmm.  Running out of a faucet or standing in a glass, the water looks fine.  Eventually discover that the water is saturated with calcium carbonate, that is, limestone, if you will, marble.  Why?  Down there, maybe 100 feet, where the water comes from, there are some old, dead sea shells, however many hundreds of millions of years old.<p>Otherwise I have a filter in the line:  The filter is a tube about one foot long and 3 inches in diameter and made from some kind of foam or a lot of string wrapped tightly.  My hardware store sells these for not very much, and they have several varieties that filter out everything down to some number of microns, different number for different varieties.  One filter lasts for over a year.<p>No evidence of disease in or from the water.<p>Yes, the calcium carbonate ruined the dishwasher, so I wash dishes in the sink and dry them a traditional dish drain rack.  I have the rack on a plastic base designed for that purpose, tilted, and set in an aluminum tray to catch the runoff water.<p>So, after some months I can notice that, while the dishes dry nicely and look just squeaky clean, from all the water that ran into the aluminum tray and evaporated, some <i>mud</i> was left behind.  So, the water seems to have calcium carbonate plus some additional dissolved solids that, after enough water has evaporated, look like mud.  Or for all I know, the &quot;mud&quot; is left over dish detergent?  Naw, I suspect the mud is dissolved solids.  Maybe if I used a finer filter I would get less mud, but I doubt it.<p>But the mud is doing me no harm.  The usual remark from the local plumbers is that the water is safe to drink, won&#x27;t hurt you.<p>On the calcium carbonate in the water, yes I could use a water softener.  Actually, I have one.  To use it, have to buy big bags, maybe 40 pounds each, of <i>rock salt</i>, that is NaCl.  The softener takes the water and converts the calcium carbonate to calcium chloride which is more soluable (doesn&#x27;t settle out on hot water pipes), doesn&#x27;t create the <i>scum</i> with old style soap does with calcium carbonate, and feels <i>soapy</i> or slippery in the water.  For the chloride in the calcium chloride, that comes from the salt, the NaCl.  For the carbonate from the calcium carbonate, that goes out the drain as sodium carbonate.  The water softener has a big barrel with <i>ion exchange resins</i>, little beads that, when flushed with water with a high concentration of NaCl, grab some of the Cl.  Then when flushed with water with calcium carbonate grab the carbonate and replace it with the chloride, thus converting the incoming calcium carbonate to calcium chloride.  But the big tank with the beads gave trouble; I paid to have the tank serviced, etc.  And the automatic unit with that tank that flushed the beads with salt water, from the big barrel of salt from the big bags of salt, gave trouble.  So, I pushed a big red button that had the water bypass the softener and unplugged the softener control unit from the wall A&#x2F;C power.  So much for the water softener.<p>Also, it does appear that calcium chloride from the softener can corrode the solder used in the copper pipes -- bummer.<p>For the calcium carbonate, it is a curious chemical since hot water dissolves less of it than cold water, the opposite of most solids.  So, when the water is heated in the hot water coils of my furnace [here I&#x27;m talking about the coils for the <i>domestic hot water</i> and not the hot water for heating the house], the calcium carbonate settles out on the inside of the coils and after six months or so lowers the flow rate of the <i>domestic</i> hot water.<p>So, I went shopping and got a length of copper water pipe, the tools to work with copper water pipe, some shutoff valves, some faucet valves, some connection fittings, some lengths of garden hose with fittings and intended as supply and drain hoses for a washing machine, a drill pump with connections for garden hoses, some plastic cups, a plastic bucket, a gallon bottle of muriatic acid, and a big, several pound size, bag of baking soda.<p>So, I used the tools and the copper pipe to install the faucet and shutoff valves at appropriate places in the copper pipes leading to and from the domestic hot water coils of the furnace and attached garden hoses to the faucet valves.  Then one of the garden hoses goes to one side of the drill pump, and a hose from the pump and another hose from the faucets go to the bucket.<p>So, using the valves, I run some water into the bucket, nearly fill the bucket.  Using an old 1&#x2F;4&quot; electric drill, I turn on the drill pump and get water flowing from the bucket, into the coils, and back to the bucket.  I put one of the little copper pipe fittings, a right angle elbow, in the bucket.<p>Then I pour about 4 ounces of the muriatic acid into one of the plastic cups, maybe the same cups apparently so popular at college frat parties or on Spring Break, and pour that acid into the bucket.  Soon I get, sure CO2 bubbles in the bucket.  Also, right, review high school chemistry, I get some calcium chloride in the bucket.  Why?  Secret:  Muriatic acid is hydrochloric acid, that is, HCl, about 28%.  In the residential construction industry, the acid is commonly used to remove, right, lime from concrete off bricks.  It also nearly instantly removes lime from the inside of copper pipes.<p>When the rate of the bubbles slows down, I add another 4 ounces of muriatic acid to the water and observe that the rate of bubbles does not increase again.  Guess:  All the calcium carbonate is out of the copper pipes.  Then I add maybe one teaspoon of the baking soda to the water and observe that I get bubbles:  Guess:  There is still plenty of hydrochloric acid in the water.  So, conclusion:  The domestic hot water pipes in the furnace are clean.<p>Then I turn off the drill pump, place the ends of the hoses that were in the bucket in a plastic tray intended for kitty litter, remove the little copper elbow from the bucket, carry the bucket to the back yard, and throw the water with the acid in a wide sweep onto the grass (I never see any effect on the grass).<p>I look at the little copper elbow for evidence that my use of the hydrochloric acid is corroding the copper pipe -- so far I have seen no such evidence.  Actually, inside the furnace, the coil for domestic hot water is lined with Teflon so that calcium carbonate will be less likely to stick; no doubt the Teflon would also protect that pipe from the acid.<p>Back in the house with the bucket, I  insert the hoses into the bucket again, use the valves to fill the bucket nearly full again, adjust the valves, turn on the drill pump, and get water flowing again from the bucket to the coils and back.<p>Then I add to the water in the bucket baking soda, about 1&#x2F;2 cup at a time, until there are no more bubbles.  Then I add another 1&#x2F;2 cup of baking soda to the water to be more sure.<p>Then, doing the right things with the drill pump, valves, and hoses again, I dump the water in the bucket again, fill the bucket again, use the drill pump to circulate relatively fresh water, turn off the drill pump, set the valves back for ordinary use, and again dump out the water in the bucket.<p>At the kitchen sink, I let the hot water run for a while to be more sure I&#x27;ve removed all the hydrochloric acid or baking soda from the water, and declare the project done -- lots of hot water flow rate now for months!<p>Of course, I don&#x27;t have a wife and six daughters in the house with each of them each day taking three baths, washing six changes of clothes, and washing their hair!<p>But, still, I have no city water, no city sewer, no sewer pipe, and no big problems.<p>Sure, when my startup is successful, I will look into getting, say, reverse osmosis to give me domestic hot&#x2F;cold water that is much closer to pure, distilled water, that is, just good, old H2O and nothing else.<p>But for India, in a place rural enough to permit the women to walk to the woods at night and use the woods as a toilet, septic tanks and wells should be a really big step up and solution to the problem.<p>About India, I&#x27;ve long suspected that such really bad aspects of their living conditions have been so common, even standard, for so long that they have long since just accepted that living like that is okay with little or no desire or effort to do anything about it.","time":1493239216,"type":"comment"}],"parent":14204702,"text":"<p><pre><code>    &gt; Unfortunately, in many places, it’s not\n    &gt; feasible to lay down sewer pipes or build\n    &gt; treatment facilities.
