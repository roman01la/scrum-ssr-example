For the last few years I have struggled with an exercise program on and off. I have consistently had the experience that it initially makes me feel better, but then I hit a plateau of a certain level of progress that makes me increasingly tired  as I try to &quot;push through&quot; and prone to getting every cold that wanders by. Well... guess who&#x27;s typing this while wearing a heart monitor for a month? My diagnosis is not yet complete but at this point I&#x27;m fairly confident I have a condition where my heart goes into some serious atrial fibrillation, only while I am asleep [1], resulting in me not being <i>aware</i> that I may have a moderately-serious heart condition probably for quite a few years (quite possibly decades) until quite recently.<p>My point is not that you may have this exact problem I have. Delores12 is also correct that this is a known effect of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, and as documented on HN that has recently been getting upgraded in the medical community from &quot;ideopathic condition we&#x27;re not sure we even believe in&quot; to a real diagnosis with a real mechanism, and there are other things this can indicate. My point is &quot;exercise actually makes me feel worse&quot; is a potentially serious symptom of something, and rather than feeling guilty about it or getting moralized at by people who do not have this experience, I would strongly suggest going to a doctor, getting a physical if you haven&#x27;t already had one, and finding a doctor who takes this seriously as a symptom if the physical doesn&#x27;t find anything immediately.<p>I wish I had gone to the doctor earlier. I have some other local health issues that mean that even now I can&#x27;t actually say what I did was <i>irrational</i> per se, indeed I even found some other issues I had in the meantime, but now I&#x27;m in a position where my condition is sufficiently bad that I&#x27;m beginning to feel like I&#x27;m in some sort of sleep deprivation torture experiment some days, worse than when I was a new parent, and I&#x27;m not joking or exaggerating for effect. Unfortunately the medical system is hard to make move faster than it wants to. If you can find what your problem is before then, you&#x27;ll be happier.<p>[1]: I do not need people to pop up with the possible causes of this; I am currently engaged with the medical system and aware of the possibilities related to apnea, etc. (I have recorded myself at night and I do not seem to have a snoring problem, so if it is apnea it&#x27;s the relatively unusual, but existing, no-snoring version.

At 2000 calories a day, that&#x27;s a ~500g (4cal&#x2F;g) budget for protein &amp; carbs.  4x nutter butter packages burns through 1k+ calories, which I&#x27;ve seen family member teenagers do while junk fooding it up, then eating multiple 1k+ calorie meals.  There&#x27;s a ridiculous amount of inadvertent overeating that is occurring with the types of convenience foods available today.<p>Most naturally occurring carbs (rice, fruit, wheat, quinoa) are generally loaded up with fiber which satiate appetite, reduce insulin&#x2F;sugar spikes, etc.  Most people don&#x27;t eat raw or minimally processed carbs through.  It&#x27;s generally consumed as soda, bread, chips&#x2F;snacks, etc, + whichever meal is being consumed that day.<p>The body&#x27;s metabolic process is pretty straightforward. Sugar is stored as glycogen in muscles &amp; liver.  Fat&#x2F;Lipids are stored as fat in the presence of insulin.  Protein is used for tissue regeneration and also converted into sugar through gluconeogenesis.  Caloric excess means extraneous fat is stored, with an additional burden placed on the heart to support the additional blood flow to having more &quot;body&quot; (more capillaries), while caloric deficit leads to the consumption of the fat reserves.<p>People would be healthier in general by merely consuming higher nutrient density foods and staying at a proper caloric maintenance.  Weighing food out for a week usually opens people eyes to the portions they are consuming.

In general, runners have a 25%–40% reduced risk of premature mortality and live approximately 3 years longer than non-runners. Recently, specific questions have emerged regarding the extent of the health benefits of running versus other types of PA, and perhaps more critically, whether there are diminishing returns on health and mortality outcomes with higher amounts of running. This review details the findings surrounding the impact of running on various health outcomes and premature mortality, highlights plausible underlying mechanisms linking running with chronic disease prevention and longevity, identifies the estimated additional life expectancy among runners and other active individuals, and discusses whether there is adequate evidence to suggest that longevity benefits are attenuated with higher doses of running.</i><p>Conclusion: <i>There is compelling evidence that running provides significant health benefits for the prevention of chronic diseases and premature mortality regardless of sex, age, body weight, and health conditions. There are strong plausible physiological mechanisms underlying how running can improve health and increase longevity. Running may be the most cost-effective lifestyle medicine from public health perspective, more important than other lifestyle and health risk factors such as smoking, obesity, HTN, and DM. It is not clear, however, how much running is safe and efficacious and whether it is possible to perform an excessive amount of exercise. Also, running may have the most public health benefits, but is not the best exercise for everyone since orthopedic or other medical conditions can restrict its use by many individuals.</i><p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S0033062017300488\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S0033062017...</a><p>NYT reporting on the study (&quot;An Hour of Running May Add 7 Hours to Your Life&quot;):<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;04&#x2F;12&#x2F;well&#x2F;move&#x2F;an-hour-of-running-may-add-seven-hours-to-your-life.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;04&#x2F;12&#x2F;well&#x2F;move&#x2F;an-hour-of-runn...</a>","time":1493131332,"type":"comment"},{"by":"Myrmornis","id":14191997,"parent":14191271,"text":"I&#x27;m 39 and I can&#x27;t do anything with my brain nowadays after exercising, so I&#x27;m looking forward to that changing when I get to 50.","time":1493113266,"type":"comment"},{"by":"readhn","id":14193819,"kids":[{"by":"itchyouch","id":14204427,"parent":14193819,"text":"It&#x27;s probably around 70-80% nutrition and 20-30% exercise&#x2F;activity.","time":1493223823,"type":"comment"}],"parent":14191271,"text":"Can a person overcome lack of exercise by eating healthy?<p>Can a person overcome lack of good nutrition by exercising regularly ?<p>Exercise goes hand in hand with nutrition IMO.

Attention is exponential and each negative story sharpens it more than the last, compounding as the cycle deepens.<p>Journalists are acutely aware of this phenomenon. Just <i>one</i> particularly controversial story can pull dozens more out of the woodwork as sources say hey, you think that&#x27;s bad, I&#x27;ve got something to talk about too.

Yes, similar things obviously happen at other companies. The difference is that for Uber, it appears as if breaking laws and&#x2F;or ethical norms was the intended modus operandi.<p>Contrary to popular opinion, companies can behave ethically,  sometimes above and beyond what is required by law. I&#x27;d say the reasons are, in descending order of importance:<p>- Companies are people, who have a strong sense of right and wrong, and are usually quite eager to stay on the right side of the line dividing the two.<p>- &quot;Company culture&quot; which, just like a society&#x27;s culture, actually sets the standards for what individuals consider right and wrong. This is what apparently broke down at Uber, because it&#x27;s established quite early in an organisation&#x27;s life. (I like to think that you can still see Steve Wozniak&#x27;s playfulness in Apple&#x27;s culture today, and that he may have stunted the worst of his co-founder&#x27;s instincts from taking Apple down a similar path).<p>- Evolution: It&#x27;s impossible for any company of significant size to keep secrets. If Google, Apple etc. were doing stuff like this on the same scale, they would no longer exist.<p>- The law, which is the codification of whatever society came up as in terms of morality<p>- &quot;Corporate Governance&quot;, which is the codification of the symbiosis of law and company culture, plus mechanisms to enforce it.<p>But even if every company were as bad, I&#x27;d have to cite my Grandfather: &quot;When did we start comparing ourselves to others?&quot;. Uber was up to a lot of stuff that shouldn&#x27;t happen, and it shouldn&#x27;t be excused. If you&#x27;re asked to participate in such things, don&#x27;t. If you fear you could be asked, or if you believe your company is forced to behave this way b&#x2F;c competitors do, lobby for mechanisms to prevent it.

The core Sugar devs wrote this little script to run through module code and its db entries to find potential XSS issues. I imagine that this would break things so its a &#x27;admin beware&#x27; type of thing they shouldn&#x27;t automate. No one wants to upgrade to Sugar 5.2 from 5.1 to find half their modules broken, so its manual.  Maybe in the future it won&#x27;t be and its a shot across the bow to third-party developers to take security seriously.<p>That&#x27;s the problem with these popular bare-bones FOSS frameworks. You get a decent core product like Drupal or even Wordpress, but you need a dozen or so modules to make it do anything useful. The code quality on random modules, is of course, random as well, so the core devs try to work around it.  Its ugly, but more an indictment against module authors than the core SugarCRM team. That team is just trying to fix the shit-code in the modules and protect the reputation of their product.

The powers that be take full advantage of this to socialize people away from meaningful competition or resistance.<p>It&#x27;s very common for people to loudly oppose a tactic and work to cast it in a negative light while they quietly go about practicing it. The negative publicity they drum up deters a lot of potential competitors from using the same tactics and makes people unlikely to believe that they&#x27;re engaging in something they &quot;fight so hard against&quot;.

Because as soon as they enter a field where there isn&#x27;t a compiler to give a binary yes&#x2F;no to their work product, perception becomes the primary field of battle.<p>That&#x27;s a hard to place to live for someone who is used to meritocracy. You soon discover that you&#x27;re vulnerable to all sorts of machinations and weaponry that you hadn&#x27;t really noticed before. You notice that people will respond to you in very strange ways that have nothing whatsoever to do with the chain of events that lead to it, demanding a type of reasoning that departs hugely from what we&#x27;re used to when we&#x27;re dealing with code.<p>It&#x27;s easy for us to think we have all of that down until we actually get in there, and then most of us end up with our heads spinning.

It&#x27;s not a simple task, and I think correctly has to analyze the mind in relation to everything else.<p>The atomic hypothesis of the Epicureans seems like a side quest into physics, but the fruit of the journey is that everything&#x27;s just combinations of atoms and the mind must be made of atoms too, so let&#x27;s think of it as a physical system with inputs and outputs, and forget about any grander god-narratives. With this perspective comes some very practical advice; Lucretius for instance has an extended passage on how to deal with a &quot;crush&quot;. I&#x27;ll paraphrase but he points out that your crush exists purely as an image in your head, and you really have no idea what the person behind the image is like, and if you finally get together the sex will probably be very awkward, so it&#x27;s better to direct your mind and amorous intentions elsewhere. I believe the phrase he used was to find smaller pleasures that carry no penalty -- because seeking the larger rewards almost always leads to misery.<p>Lucretius is a good read and the Latham translation has some felicitous turns of phrase. It&#x27;s fun imagining arguing with the ancient philosophers about their physical theories, which they support (as best they can) with the available evidence about what wind, liquids, lightning, thunder, earthquakes, smells, tastes, sights, etc. are made of. It&#x27;s a shame philosophy got distracted with &quot;higher things&quot; for so long (i.e. 2,000 years) because here we are realizing again that everything is made of atoms, and it sure would be nice to have more advice on living life in the face of this fact.","time":1493190085,"type":"comment"},{"by":"vivekd","id":14201023,"kids":[{"by":"freeflight","id":14201241,"kids":[{"by":"vivekd","id":14201422,"kids":[{"by":"narag","id":14201454,"parent":14201422,"text":"Unfortunately those ancient greeks didn&#x27;t have Google to know better ;)","time":1493196032,"type":"comment"}],"parent":14201241,"text":"&gt;What definition of hedonism are you using that necessarily involves marriage, eating meat or being a sex maniac?<p>the google definition:<p>the pursuit of pleasure; sensual self-indulgence.

One person is uninsured, so they get a bill for the full amount. The other is insured, so their insurance company gets a bill for 15K. The insurance company has an existing agreement with the hospital and says &quot;We&#x27;re only going to pay 12K&quot; and that&#x27;s what the hospital gets.

Now the other hospital across town is free to offer the same procedure for 13K or 8K or 25K - whatever they think they can get, but they have to charge that price to all patients.

I like this tool a lot. It&#x27;s simple, responsive, fast, and covers nearly all the relevant data points without any obfuscating clutter.<p>There are a couple items we look for that might be worth including in the CSV exports, depending on what kind of scale you want to plan for. Specifically:<p><pre><code>  1. Project name,\n  2. Project ID or number, \n  3. Employee name, \n  4. Employee ID or number, \n  5. Employee email, \n  6. Supervisor name, \n  7. Supervisor employee ID or number, \n  8. Supervisor email, \n  9. Task or activity code, and \n  10. Task or activity description. \n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s important for us to be able to line up time tracking data to W2 data from a payroll system, which is frequently hosted separately with different data standards. So employee numbers (not SSNs obviously) really help when dealing with larger companies where a significant number of employee names may change (e.g. due to marriage) or may be formatted with slight variations (e.g. nicknames instead of full legal), or where the odds of a name collision are high. We also like to see departments, cost centers, legal entities, locations, lines of business, etc. where applicable, but we can usually layer those on from other data sources if we can join on a unique identifier, whether it&#x27;s at the project, task, or employee level.<p>If I can get that data in a single CSV export for all employees at a company, I&#x27;m like 70% done with the calculation.<p>And while this sounds like an odd use case, pretty much any profitable company doing software development in the US should be claiming the credit (and actually in pretty much any developed country, because most have a credit that was modeled on the US&#x27;s). Even smaller shops with only a handful of employees usually see substantial benefit. Having the data formatted like this up front reduces the costs of doing an R&amp;D credit study and dramatically reduces the odds of an adverse adjustment in exam or audit. Especially when the employees have been diligent about recording their time and the associated activity&#x2F;project&#x2F;task data. It&#x27;s also worth noting that this is one area of the tax code that does not seem likely to be affected by tax reform as both the Ryan and Trump plans propose to leave the credit as it is.<p>Edit: oh and I forgot because this doesn&#x27;t relate to my work, but having an option for charge codes is nice.

On the one hand, I think that you could argue that there is indeed some limited subset of words that can be used to say everything that can be said in a given language.  One way to prove this, perhaps, would be to count all of the words that are used in the definitions in a given dictionary.  I suspect that in most dictionaries, the total number of unique words used in the dictionary definitions is less than the total number of defined words.<p>This is related to what you wrote, &quot;in practice, words are continually added to a language when new things need to be described&quot;. Consider new technologies for which new words are invented: these can generally be defined using the existing set of words in a language.  The new word just provides a one- or two-word short form method of referring to that technology.<p>On the other hand, there are certain things - and I&#x27;m thinking specifically of human experiences as one set of those things - which are not easily summarized in a sentence and these get their own words.  Consider emotions as one example.  As the set of &quot;known&quot; human experiences (emotions, perspectives, etc.) grows, based on a more sophisticated understanding of human nature (via psychology, literature, etc.), new words are needed.

They don&#x27;t even necessarily have to know why they&#x27;re doing it or what it ought to look like in an applicant, but they look for it anyways. So ways to make sure you&#x27;re ticking this checkbox are making sure you&#x27;re enthusiastic about coding and speak with excitement about what you&#x27;re doing and the be excited about the company&#x27;s core values. For example, most companies are consumer facing, so you need to get jazzed about providing the best user experience possible and be motivated by seeing people use your product and interacting with users and their feedback. The best advice I could give here is to make sure you do your research on the company, tailor your resume&#x2F;cover letter&#x2F;responses to match them, and just fake it till you make it.<p>Personal Projects: The other piece that applicants tend to not have (particularly people just entering the field) is solid portfolio work. One key aspect of that is open source contributions. Get excited by a framework or a library and not only become an expert on it, but get involved in the developer community and start contributing to the project on  Github. The other important piece is projects that are real. Something that is original and actually solves a problem, something that people outside of your circle have used. Everyone and their mother has class assignment projects or online tutorial walkthroughs (kanbans, todo list, simple fetch from api and display, personal website). Only a very small fraction of people coming out of college or a bootcamp have a project that goes beyond the basics and teeters on being an actual product.<p>So my advice is to put more emphasis on those two aspects, make sure you&#x27;re getting involved in the community online and in person via meetups (referrals are gold and trump just about anything), and avoid shotgunning for interviews (pick a few companies and focus on them).","time":1493306134,"type":"comment"},{"by":"pseshadri","id":14216452,"kids":[{"by":"dsacco","id":14229182,"parent":14216452,"text":"This is basically the worst way you can attempt to get a job.

A little over a year ago I moved to NYC to attend a Full Stack Python Coding Bootcamp. I flew through the course, and upon finishing had bright eyes and a lot of enthusiasm to begin a career in tech. The teachers threw their support behind me, and let me know that I was a strong developer (and more importantly a fast learner) and should have no problem finding a job. Fast forward to now - I have been looking for a career full time since July 2016 with no luck. I’ve been interviewing a lot, but ultimately get passed over for people with more experience. I’m going into debt at this point, and don’t know where to turn or what to do to get my shot.<p>I know companies here are really pressing a CS degree - which I don’t have. I do have a BS in Petroleum Engineer, and have work experience as an engineer. I also managed a Oil &amp; Gas service company in Africa for years before making this transition, so I have quality professional experience. I left my career to embark on this journey into technology, so I have proof of my passion and commitment to this change. I’m not sure where to turn or what to do at this point, but I know I want to be working in tech.<p>I have been a finalist for many jobs, but no offers to date. Some companies are great about going in another direction and giving feedback, and other companies give me none. Last month I interviewed at Foursquare - two phone interviews, a project, two more in person interviews - wait two weeks and receive a generic email (“While we felt your experience was great, it didn&#x27;t quite align with what we&#x27;re looking for at this time.”). I’ve sent emails asking for more feedback and received no replies.<p>If you have any thoughts as to what I can to do get my first job in technology, I would be grateful."},"14202095":{"time":1493205499,"type":"story","descendants":7,"title":"As a musician's memory faded, his family saved the music still in his head","kids":[{"by":"camtarn","id":14203192,"parent":14202095,"text":"TL;DR: an amateur composer who never learned to write down his music is developing Alzheimer&#x27;s, and slowly forgetting how to play the songs he wrote.

It means stop acting like a child and grow the F up. There is also &quot;Amaesugi&quot; (too much) and &quot;Amaenbou&quot; (someone who does too much) which are not positive terms. Then there is &quot;Mazakon&quot; which is short for mother complex.

When I was little, I was an amaenbou. But I did well in school because I had good studying habits, and my mother paid attention to how I did and how I did it. I had a stress free childhood, did well in school, and did not need amae to counteract my stress. None of my friends were stressed out either. Being a kid in Japan is fun.

In short, the five clinging-aggregates are dukkha.&quot;<p>Dukkha is the word used by the Buddha to describe stressfulness, unsatisfactoriness, suffering, anguish etc., i.e that pain which is emotional; his position is that these arise from our desire to be stable, and from that desire acting upon it, to try and slow the tides of change. At least, that is my understanding.<p>But non-attachment to people need not mean that one stops feeling compassion for them, nor does it mean that one has to break up with one&#x27;s friends. It&#x27;s more about being mindful of the kind of relationships you have, and how they affect you. For example, one of the Buddha&#x27;s prescribed techniques is to meditate on the theme of death, that one&#x27;s body will eventually die, to visualise each process of birth, aging, sickness, death, one&#x27;s decomposing body, the bones left over, those bones themselves yellowing and decomposing.<p>But here we have even the most important of all - detachment from one&#x27;s own body. I don&#x27;t mean this in a kind of &quot;outer body experience&quot; way. It&#x27;s not that one stops caring, it&#x27;s that one understands on an emotional level that things pass; it&#x27;s not enough to understand this on an intellectual level. This kind of base understanding within us, acheived through meditation, is referred to as nibbana&#x2F;awakening&#x2F;enlightenment.<p>&gt;&quot;Just as if a great mass of fire of ten... twenty... thirty or forty cartloads of timber were burning, and into it a man would time &amp; again throw dried grass, dried cow dung, &amp; dried timber, so that the great mass of fire — thus nourished, thus sustained — would burn for a long, long time. In the same way, in one who keeps focusing on the allure of clingable phenomena, craving develops. From craving as a requisite condition comes clinging&#x2F;sustenance. From clinging&#x2F;sustenance as a requisite condition comes becoming. From becoming as a requisite condition comes birth. From birth as a requisite condition, then aging &amp; death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, &amp; despair come into play. Such is the origin of this entire mass of suffering &amp; stress.","time":1493141394,"type":"comment"}],"parent":14194929,"text":"Reading this article now, but this is about attachment to another person through relationships.

We&#x27;ve tried very hard to make our product secure, but users almost never ask about that. We have <i>never</i> been asked about the quality of our crypto by a regular user, and only once by an enterprise user. Users care about UX and cost, in roughly that order, and little else. This is even true of <i>most</i> enterprise users.<p>This is why security sucks. This is why everything spies on you. It&#x27;s not a priority for anyone because it doesn&#x27;t affect user buying behavior. The tiny minority who do care are not only too small to matter but also tend to be the kinds of &quot;hackers&quot; who like to DIY (and pirate) rather than buy things... making them doubly economically insignificant.<p>In the end the privacy issues around things like this will have to be fixed with legislation. We will need to effectively extend HIPAA regulations to cover all kinds of other personal data: passively recorded audio and video, location tracking data, anything more than the most superficial user logging, etc. Vendors will face a fine of $$$ per incident if this information is leaked, and sale and use of information will be strictly regulated.<p>As far as government surveillance goes: that horse left the barn over a decade ago, and that also can only be fixed in the legislature.

I&#x27;d probably clean up the sides and use something nicer than veroboard for the grille, if I were making this myself, but it&#x27;s a very good first approximation to say the least.<p>And Adafruit&#x27;s method solves the major problem, of where to find a suitable lens to replace the rather expensive [2] original prop part, very handily! Unfortunately, they&#x27;re out of stock of the rather crucial button, but Sparkfun appears [3] to have no trouble sourcing them.<p>ETA: On further reading, I wouldn&#x27;t follow this Adafruit method; I don&#x27;t have access to a laser cutter, and even if I did, having the tabs stick out the side, and the whole thing sort of jigsawed together that way, doesn&#x27;t appeal.<p>Instead, I&#x27;d work up a frame from aluminum bar stock, which isn&#x27;t all that much harder to work with than plastic, and build the faceplate to mount picture-frame-style in a groove milled into the inside face of the bar. If you&#x27;ve got access to a laser cutter, you probably also have, or can easily enough get access to, a milling machine, whether CNC or manual - they even make mini-XY tables with Dremel mounts, which might actually be preferable for a small job like this to something more like a Bridgeport machine. (If you do want some smarts in there, you can have as much room for them as you need - just pick a suitably sized bar stock. The groove will be near the front edge in any case, since the prop doesn&#x27;t have a lot of depth there; the rest is just trading off between how much space you have behind the faceplate, and how proud of the wall you want the finished item to be.)<p>Also, since I (again) don&#x27;t have access to a laser cutter, I&#x27;d cut down the grille from the door RF shield out of a scrap-heap microwave. If you don&#x27;t have one of those lying around - and why would you? - your local junkyard does, and who doesn&#x27;t love a trip to the junkyard? Shouldn&#x27;t cost more than a few bucks; if you bring your dikes and don&#x27;t mind maybe having to stitch up a hole in a pocket, you can probably cut the piece you need and smuggle it out without paying a cent, although you probably want to be paying for something else at the same time so it doesn&#x27;t look too sketchy.<p>Looks like a fun project, in any case, laser cutter or no!<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cdn-learn.adafruit.com&#x2F;downloads&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;hal-9000-replica.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cdn-learn.adafruit.com&#x2F;downloads&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;hal-9000-replic...</a><p>[2] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kenrockwell.com&#x2F;nikon&#x2F;8mm-f8.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kenrockwell.com&#x2F;nikon&#x2F;8mm-f8.htm</a><p>[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sparkfun.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;9181\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sparkfun.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;9181</a>","time":1493221787,"type":"comment"}],"parent":14203772,"text":"You know, if Amazon made an Echo that hung on the wall and had Hal&#x27;s red &quot;eye&quot;, I think I would have to get one despite myself.","time":1493220998,"type":"comment"},{"by":"inopinatus","id":14203958,"parent":14203772,"text":"I saw the same.

Usually when we talk about the Panopticon in the modern era, we&#x27;re talking about mass surveillance or the performative act of social media. When we act in a certain (digital) way, posting this link, for example, we signal our values to the community. &quot;You shall be known by your works&quot;. However, this kind of technology makes for an even more interesting and more troubling application of the Panopticon.<p>Foucault says that the group eventually becomes its own control system without the need for the central observers, that we are all at the center of our own panopticons. We watch others unfailingly, assessing their actions and putting them back in line when they stray. As we are socialized, we become more entrenched in our system of values: wear makeup, don&#x27;t get fat, don&#x27;t smell like cigs, don&#x27;t wear stripes and plaid, and for god&#x27;s sake: don&#x27;t look like you&#x27;re trying to hard to conform to all of this. We are both observer and observed, traversing endless nets of social expectations.<p>Now, instead of your peer group enforcing social expectations, we have got machines in on it! The result is something blatantly dystopian - a system that will correct you in your home before you dare venture out looking like <i>that</i> and embarrass yourself in front of the others. As it learns, it will learn even more that we value large breasts (but also modesty), pale skin, sleek clothes on slim waists, bodies with bulbous lips and thighs and pastel face paints. It will advise those without a perfect body to get one, and it sure as hell will provide the means by which to do so: consumption. New makeup, new tights, new corsets that you can clamp so tight it&#x27;ll squeeze you into a form the camera will approve, new ways to take selfies every day to show your followers that you care enough to buy this piece of surveillance equipment so that you can &quot;look good&quot; without those pricey fashion magazines and stupid blogs!","time":1493223782,"type":"comment"},{"by":"petra","id":14204075,"kids":[{"by":"AlexandrB","id":14204267,"parent":14204075,"text":"&gt; 1.

They actually existed if you can believe it...) so I&#x27;ll leave you to draw your conclusions about what a story like that would entail. The way McCarthy makes those types of scenes digestible is by almost always describing them in the past tense. You the reader come upon them after they happened. He also writes with a detachment to the event and speaks of some downright unspeakable acts almost matter of factly. I am pretty squeamish and I could handle it so you&#x27;ll probably be fine because of that.<p>The Road I found harder to read than BM. Its less violent (although there are a couple spots that get pretty gruesome) but just unrelentingly bleak and grim. I needed to lie down after reading it.

I dont know.<p>&gt;Did it meet some need? No. The other five thousand plus mammals among us do fine without it. But useful? Oh yes.<p>&gt; There is no selection at work in the evolution of language because language is not a biological system and because there is only one of them<p>Organisms don&#x27;t &#x27;wait&#x27; for new traits to come along. They just come along and if they are useful and benefit the organism, they propagate across the population through successful reproduction. Evolved traits propagate themselves precisely through being useful in helping the organism survive and reproduce. McCarthy doesn&#x27;t seem to understand the elementary process by which natural selection functions.<p>&gt;The invention of language was understood at once to be incredibly useful. Again, it seems to have spread through the species almost instantaneously.<p>&gt;For while it is fairly certain that art preceded language it probably didnt precede it by much.<p>There is absolutely no evidence for any of this whatsoever. It&#x27;s pure supposition. How can he know language propagated so fast and arose so suddenly? Some evolutionary biologists analyzing the physiology of early hominids think there is evidence of physical adaptations for language as far back as Homo Ergaster over a million years ago, but vocal language leaves no archaeological evidence. There is just no way to know how long it took to develop to modern forms and no reason to suppose that physical representation in the form of art predates spoken language.<p>Edit:\nMcCormack&#x27;s premise seems to be that Language did not evolve from any preceding capacity, including any preceding ability to communicate. We know that modern primates other than humans communicate in very primitive pre-linguistic ways, but McCormack specifically dismisses the idea that human language is descended from or evolved from similar capabilities in our common ancestors. This seems absurd to me on several grounds.<p>Our common primate ancestors did not have vocal cords or throat configurations capable of modern speech, or anything close to it. McCormack even points this out in the essay and highlights the fact that reconfiguring our throats for speech is, independent of any advantage language gives us, a serious disadvantage because it makes us more susceptible to choking. Yet then he goes on to say that language gives us no evolutionary advantage because it’s ‘not a biological system’. If it gives no evolutionary advantage, how does it compensate for the increased risk of choking?<p>Speech-like non-verbal communication must have preceded physical adaptation in order to make the adaptation advantageous, otherwise there would again have been no compensating factor for the choking risk. So early forms of language-like communication would necessarily have been non-verbal (by which I mean involving gestures sounds like those made by some other modern primates but not &#x27;spoken&#x27;). This early communication was less efficient and advantageous than spoken communication, otherwise physical adaptations for spoken communication would not have increased fitness.<p>So it seems far more plausible that language-like communication originated as more complex forms of gestures and sounds our common primate ancestors already used and then evolved into a form dominated by spoken language in order to increase it’s efficiency. After all, our ancestors going back millions of years had complex physical culture including manufacturing composite artefacts, creating and managing fire, processing and cooking food. All of these would need to be taught somehow. Yet McCormack’s thesis is that this teaching involved communications no more sophisticated than the basic communications we see in other primates and other mammals today, until spoken language somehow burst on to the scene fully formed 100k years ago.","time":1493125345,"type":"comment"},{"by":"anotherthrowxy","dead":true,"id":14191460,"parent":14190281,"text":"If you want to really experience McCarty&#x27;s The Road - get some headphones, put Godspped You Black Emperor: F A ∞ on repeat - and spend a couple hours reading it.

So no, it&#x27;s not a good thing - because it means that if you&#x27;re born poor, you stay poor.

In a general sense, the language is designed to prevent the need for explicit allocations and pointers as much as possible. The runtime uses a secondary stack to return dynamically-sized objects from functions. The low level parameter passing details are also compiler-controlled. The programmer specifies how an argument is used (input, output, or both) and the compiler deals with how to accomplish that. There are some other features (mostly related to types and bounds) that all combine to generally reduce the need for explicit memory management.<p>Once you do get to explicit memory management, Ada does a number of things. I&#x27;m going to a list here just for my own sanity.<p>First, all deallocations are essentially marked unsafe. You use Unchecked_Deallocation() to free memory.<p>More importantly, it provides memory pools, and subpools. Each pointer type can be associated with a pool (or subpool). Once the pool goes out of scope, all memory is freed. You can use this to avoid explicit deallocations yourself. Pools also control allocations and deallocations, and there exist Debug pools that can help ensure memory is accessed correctly.<p>Ada also requires that stack-based objects be declared as &quot;aliased&quot; before you may make a pointer to them, so it&#x27;s always clear where there might be trouble.<p>Finally (I think), Ada has a concept of accessibility levels. Essentially a pointer cannot point to an object that is more deeply scoped than itself. This isn&#x27;t the perfection of the Rust borrow checker, but it does quite a bit.<p>As for C FFI, Ada does that quite well.

And it goes further and dips into memory safety and concurrency. It doesn&#x27;t such an extreme tact as Rust, but it does an awful lot to provide good options that allow you to avoid many issues. And it generally tries to make programs easy to understand. And more - some of which, as the article notes, are really quite wonderful for going really low level.<p>Personally I see the most value in the semantic type safety. That&#x27;s really been, in my own experience, where Ada has helped me the most. Many of the other features are also great. I just don&#x27;t see almost any of it in Rust.

There was a discussion on &#x2F;r&#x2F;technology yesterday where people were discussing how it was exactly the other way round – Ada has weird syntax (so many English words!) which slows adoption, and Rust is C-like enough that the target market of C&#x2F;C++ users can pick it up, syntactically at least. I&#x27;m saying this having done a distributed systems course in Ada. It felt like writing a novel, about some very awkward people announcing every action as they did it. Rust, on the other hand, feels like pair programming with a wizard (the compiler) who knows how to write really great C++ and has many tips to share.<p>Rust&#x27;s syntax is, like many new languages as they are invented, essentially a pick of the crop of the best syntax ideas from other languages. &#x27;Best&#x27; is probably debatable but familiarity is certainly not. Type annotations are basically Scala syntax. Class::method(), ditching `return` in favour of last-line expressions and the || {} closure syntax are all pretty close to Ruby. Structs&#x2F;enums are also basically Scala. `instance.method()`, and pretty much the rest of the language, is universal.<p>It&#x27;s true, Scala syntax for types is the weirdest part, but once you know what it means it&#x27;s not hard to decipher. Much easier than trying to figure out function pointers in C, if you ask me.<p>#2 is probably true, but that&#x27;s the cost of staying close to the metal. Rust makes all your memory access very explicit, rather than bundling it up in the standard&#x2F;GC or leaving it to you. But it&#x27;s a model you can get used to, and it has value as a mental model aside from its application in Rust.<p>#3 – well. Ada was young once.

Assuming you use GNAT, the compiler is written in Ada and the backend is gcc, and you have the same optimization options as C in gcc.<p>I&#x27;d say its performance is usually in the range of C++ performance. You can make it as fast as C, of course, because nobody forces you to do object-oriented programming (tagged types in Ada) and all runtime checks can be switched off with pragmas. However, I don&#x27;t think that many Ada programmers are interested in that.<p>In a nutshell, speed is not a reason to opt for Ada over C. Safety and maintainability are. As for reasons for going the other way, there are plenty of them. Getting Ada programs to compile can take a long time, especially when you&#x27;re learning the language, and the learning curve is relatively steep. Ada is a huge language in comparison to C and it&#x27;s syntax is &quot;per-construct&quot; - it looks easy but there is a lot more to learn in comparison to, say, Pascal.

We’ve known for a long time that methane is a far more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide (CO2), which is released when any hydrocarbon, like natural gas, is burned. But the IPCC’s latest report, released Monday (big PDF here), reports that methane is 34 times stronger a heat-trapping gas than CO2 over a 100-year time scale, so its global-warming potential (GWP) is 34. That is a nearly 40% increase from the IPCC’s previous estimate of 25. ...The IPCC reports that, over a 20-year time frame, methane has a global warming potential of 86 compared to CO2, up from its previous estimate of 72. Given that we are approaching real, irreversible tipping points in the climate system, climate studies should, at the very least, include analyses that use this 20-year time horizon. Finally, it bears repeating that natural gas from even the best fracked wells is still a climate-destroying fossil fuel.

There have been periods of ebb and flow that many workers and their families have managed to &quot;wait out&quot; in the past.<p>Further, if you&#x27;ve lived your entire life in a coal town, the sheer scale of the plants, mines, railroads, and other  infrastructure can make them seem permanent, reliable. It is very difficult to imagine so much specialized infrastructure simply ... going away.<p>Imagine if you had spent your entire life as a datacenter tech, as had your father. You knew the business inside and out, understood the network of suppliers, the customers, the hardware, everything. You&#x27;ve gotten into arguments about different rack configurations and which you prefer to work on. This is your career. You got into this business because it would provide a stable life for you and your family, and you were damn good at it. Then people started telling you that we would no longer need datacenters - at all -  in 5 years because there were now cheaper, better alternatives. You wouldn&#x27;t believe them.","time":1493220726,"type":"comment"},{"by":"ryanmarsh","id":14203758,"kids":[{"by":"matty22","id":14205300,"parent":14203758,"text":"I grew up in West Virginia.

If that were the only or best metric. In a consumption-oriented economy it may be considered that.<p>Creating things that last years, decades, generations, doesn&#x27;t keep the economy &quot;moving&quot; in this sense. It can cause some sectors to fail (a sort of boom-bust). If you create a near perfect product that lasts decades, you have an immediate need to ramp up production (to meet demand). Once the demand tapers off due to market penetration, growth slows, and then you shrink--potentially rapidly. If the product doesn&#x27;t expire frequently (break, wear out, get lost, something) and is a non-consumable good, then your production needs to drop off or you need to make different things.<p>I worked for an employer once that was in that situation.

It upends the traditional order of topics in an intro physics class: it starts with conservation laws rather than F=ma, both because they&#x27;re more fundamental (you&#x27;re not going to use F=ma in quantum mechanics, but you&#x27;ll sure use energy) and because students taking calculus concurrently will have learned about derivatives there by the time you get to acceleration and <i>really</i> need to start understanding them. Lots of other pedagogically novel features, too.<p>Another favorite of mine that might be especially interesting to the HN crowd is Chabay and Sherwood&#x27;s <i>Matter and Interactions</i> text. One key feature is its tight integration of simulations using &quot;VPython&quot;, which students start to use within the first few weeks of class. That makes it viable to have students study realistic forces rather than just the simplest cases. (E.g. adding air resistance to projectile motion is just one more line of code, rather than requiring a course in differential equations.) That also makes it more reasonable for their book to give <i>true</i> equations from the start (like the equation for relativistic momentum rather than just p=mv) and then state the more familiar forms as approximations.<p>Randall Knight&#x27;s <i>Physics for Scientists and Engineers</i> is a much more standard text than those two, but it&#x27;s still worlds better than most traditional texts that I&#x27;ve used: it changes the old standards in smaller ways, but still incorporating lots of research-based improvements. (Knight&#x27;s little book &#x2F;Five Easy Lessons: Strategies for Successful Physics Teaching&#x2F; was a great introduction to Physics Education Research for me when I first started teaching, too.)<p>Eric Mazur, one of the real leaders of the Physics Education Research community, wrote a book not long ago called &#x2F;Principles and Practice of Physics&#x2F;. I haven&#x27;t had a chance to really go through it in detail yet to get a feel for everything that makes it unique (one big structural change from tradition is that he focuses on students getting rock solid on 1D physics before introducing the complications of vectors), but he&#x27;s such an expert in this stuff that I wouldn&#x27;t want to leave his book off of the list. (It&#x27;s organized in a bit of a weird way, mind you.)<p>I&#x27;m sure there are others that I haven&#x27;t thought to list.

For example, header images and flair colors will be rendered correctly on desktop and mobile.<p>We know great things happen when we give users as much flexibility as possible. The menu of options we’ll provide for customization is still being determined. Our starting point is to replicate as many of the existing uses that already exist, and to expand beyond as we evolve.</i><p>Sounds like they&#x27;re trying to keep the same flexibility as the existing CSS options, which is a bit different than removing styling.<p>On the other hand, there are a lot of concerns with the approach Reddit is taking: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;modnews&#x2F;comments&#x2F;66q4is&#x2F;the_web_redesign_css_and_mod_tools&#x2F;dgkv91d&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;modnews&#x2F;comments&#x2F;66q4is&#x2F;the_web_red...</a>","time":1493178410,"type":"comment"},{"by":"tomschlick","id":14200145,"parent":14198810,"text":"As far as I can tell, the custom CSS is holding reddit back from any type of optimization&#x2F;modernization of the HTML markup.

Flickr is still up and running, even if crammed with ads sending uBlock into a frenzy.<p>If anything, photographic collections and studies don&#x27;t have the appeal they once had due to the trillions of images we see everywhere now. The eyesore of over-sharpened, over-saturated, too high dynamic ranged retina candy. Good photography now is back in the galleries where it should be...IMHO, the image resting on a print not emitting any light of its own. No blinding pixels, and hopefully matte paper, no glass.","time":1493142917,"type":"comment"},{"by":"et-al","id":14195959,"kids":[{"by":"yeukhon","id":14196840,"kids":[{"by":"et-al","id":14197321,"parent":14196840,"text":"&gt; <i>Was there ever a community like, say, Reddit or Facebook Page.

Li Si unified the script in the form of &quot;Lesser Seal&quot;, but this script wasn&#x27;t used much except for, if I recall correctly, official proclamations, engravings and whatnot.<p>At that time the first emperor purged the bureaucratic class, except for a small school of philosophers, and delegated most clerical tasks down to military officers and slaves. These people absolutely butchered the script and replaced its refined artistic regularity with a more casual free-form style. This is called Li Shu or &quot;clerical script&quot;.<p>Fast forward a hundred years or so, the new emperor is kinder to Confucianists and the academics are out of hiding. Now the scholars have a choice: use the standard script of Li Si or adopt the messy free-form style of the officers and slaves. The amazing thing is that they chose to use clerical script and did a complete re-interpretation of the aesthetics of Chinese writing based on the characteristics of that script. The &quot;refined&quot; artists of the later eras appreciated how fluid and dynamic the writing of untrained scribes was and incorporated those qualities into a completely new standard.

The mainframes themselves sit in a box, but many other systems rely on their data and their guaranteed processing.  And all of those connections and data structures are custom.  Even if you were to figure out some way to completely emulate the system (and that itself would probably take several years), you would then need to integrate your emulated system into other real-time systems.  A bank just can&#x27;t shut down for a day.  And if they screw up a few minutes worth of transactions, then things get very bad.

They identify subsets of functionality where they feel the current mainframe system is most limited – e.g. mortgages, mobile banking, whatever – and start by replacing that function only with the new non-mainframe software, and have it integrate with the pre-existing mainframe app for other functions. Then, the idea is, progressively they will migrate more and more functionality to the new system, and eventually the mainframe&#x2F;COBOL systems can be retired.

They licence the software, and usually the job of running the system, from a software house. The article is based on an intervjue of the CEO of Auka. Auka is a software house for a peripheral  piece of banking software. (read, he&#x27;s selling software licenses). Try to look at this from the banks point of view.<p>My first job was in one of these software houses for banking and finance(B&amp;F) who made both core system and peripheral software.<p>A bunch of us programmers tried to make the same sell to one of the bankers we had on staff. (You need bankers to do the job of products manager in this business). He looked at us like we&#x27;re morons, and asked a rather pointed question: &quot;OK, say we rewrite the whole software stack in C++ (this was 1998).  What NEW banking products can we make in C++ we CAN&#x27;T make in cobol?&quot; Answers is of course; None, zip, nada. Last time you changed bank, did you ask who&#x27;s banking system is being used and in what language it was written in ? I&#x27;m guessing not.<p>So banks go to the software houses to license a core banking system, and they care pretty much about only two things:\n1) Is it solid (i.e bug free. Few things evaporate trust in a bank faster than there being questions about the banks ability to do basic math right). \n2) price<p>There have been a few cases when a new core banking system have been written from scratch, and most have been failures due to being too buggy when launched. Word get out among the banks and the system is dead. All will wait until it&#x27;s proven, no one will be the first one out of the gate. The bug free requirement is a show stopper from the getgo.<p>On to price. The development cost of such a system is in the neighborhood of 250 - 500 million USD. The only way to get that down is to strip down the features to a much simple system. The other software houses are just going to sell an existing cobol system, with disabled features to match yours, and underbid you.<p>Bankers, unlike most CS majors, actually understand how to calculate cost of investments! Say 500M USD development cost, a future value calculation will yield that you&#x27;ll need a return-on-investment (ROI) of 20-50M US EVERY YEAR FROM HERE TO INFINITY to make the investment pay off. (That&#x27;s PROFITS, not revenue)<p>Core banking systems are so feature stable, and have been so thoroughly debugged over DECADES, that there is very little maintenance to be done. I&#x27;d expect that each of these systems have a staff of 10-20 programmers maintaining them (and they spend a lot of time doing other things). How big a staff of maintainer will you new banking system need after launch? Even if it was zero and you assume you pay each maintenance programmer 250k USD, a staff of 20 still only cost 5M USD.<p>The article have a section &quot;what can the banks do&quot; left out a fourth option. Instead of using CS majors to code cobol, you use B&amp;F majors, and give them a 1-2 year education on doing cobol programming. The CS majors need 1-2 years of on the job experience to reach a B&amp;F Bachelor level understanding of what a core banking system need to do anyway. Cost is the same.<p>One last point, say you do write a new system today your choice of language will be either Java or C#. As database there is no viable alternative to SQL. In 30 years no fresh CS major will touch Java or C# with a ten foot pole, and you&#x27;ll have to do another rewrite to the tune of 100-200M USD (assuming that programming will require less hands).<p>Much cheaper to keep on educating non CS majors to do cobol.","time":1493234630,"type":"comment"},{"by":"dbg31415","id":14203591,"parent":14202585,"text":"And we should all switch to Metric, give up fast foods, and call our mothers once a week... but look, it&#x27;s never that simple because all of these things take effort.","time":1493219367,"type":"comment"}],"id":14202585,"score":79,"url":"https://thenextweb.com/finance/2017/04/25/banks-should-let-ancient-programming-language-cobol-die/","by":"artsandsci"},"14218970":{"time":1493384129,"type":"story","descendants":47,"title":"Ask HN: What's the best way to learn about testing/TDD?","kids":[{"by":"gwbas1c","id":14219137,"kids":[{"by":"daleharvey","id":14219164,"parent":14219137,"text":"There is nothing more reliable about manual testing than automated testing.

And I habitually go through OSS projects I use to look at their tests and see what techniques I might not know about.  This is really useful when you&#x27;re picking up a new language or paradigm (e.g. when I started using functional languages over the OO languages I was used to.)<p>The basic thing you need to remember about testing is the AAA approach[2]: Arrange (setup); Act(do the thing you&#x27;re testing); Assert (measure the outcome to make sure it is what you were expecting). Just about everything you read on testing at a lower level is going to come down to that procedure. There&#x27;s additional techniques like fuzz testing and property testing, but they&#x27;re not common.  At a junior level I&#x27;d just expect you to have a basic understanding of AAA and how to apply it to common situations with the toolkit of your choice (e.g. for a javascript dev, maybe jest).<p>When you think about it, you already test your software, as you write it—its just that instead of writing down the steps in a way that your test framework can use, you&#x27;re doing it manually. So really you just need to learn how to write down what you&#x27;re doing in the browser (or whatever your interface is).

You can also use one formula to describe one step of a build (say, compiling a base image), and then output the resulting filesystem... it&#x27;s assigned a hash, and you can use this as an input to another formula.

From both a security perspective and from a code maintainability perspective I&#x27;d argue that it&#x27;s long been understood that good software should be able to except any arbitrary input and, using the same code paths as for valid inputs, generate output without compromising the internal state of the program.<p>Garbage in is garbage out isn&#x27;t just an excuse; it should be a design goal.<p>Real world example: data injection bugs. To this very day many exploits rely on SQL injection or shell injection bugs. We&#x27;ve known forever that the proper solution to these bugs isn&#x27;t to escape or validate input strings. The analysis logic, being entirely divorced from the SQL or shell parsing code, will always be out-of-step and susceptible to bit rot. The proper solution is to design your interfaces so that user data strings are never intermingled with code strings. In SQL that means using parameter substitution using &quot;?&quot;.<p>Another example: The Lua VM is a byte code interpreter. In Lua 5.1 that byte code loader included a verification pass that tried to ensure sane byte code is loaded. The problem is that that the verifier was different code from the execution component, and there were always constructs the verifier missed which could cause the execution component to enter unexpected states that could lead to arbitrary memory reads or writes. In Lua 5.3 there is no longer any byte code verifier. It was ripped out entirely. Some of the time spent on the verifier was spent improving the execution engine to handle bad byte code better. More importantly, there&#x27;s no verifier for people to blame when they rely on loading untrusted byte code. Lua 5.3 is no less secure than Lua 5.1, and arguably more secure.<p>Another example: arithmetic overflow. Many arithmetic overflow bugs come from code which tried to validate the range of inputs but missed some corner cases. Usually it&#x27;s better and easier to refactor the algorithm so that malicious inputs provably produce benign (if non-sense) outputs. It&#x27;s one reason why I always used unsigned integers in the context of data structure descriptions. Unsigned modulo arithmetic ensures that I&#x27;ll always be dealing with positive values, removing the need to deal with negative values (not to mention worry about the undefined nature of signed overflow). There are exceptions, and unsigned integers are hardly sufficient alone, but on balance that approach is simpler and significantly improves the robustness of memory management in C.<p>Input validation is really only good for debugging and diagnostics. Often the earlier you can catch invalid input the better your diagnostics can be. That&#x27;s a user interface issue, though. If your architecture relies on validation for correct behavior, I would argue it&#x27;s likely to be fundamentally broken. Or rather, the more it relies on validation the further from it is from ideal software.<p>Indeed, that&#x27;s the whole idea behind Curve25519--that any 32-byte secret key is a valid key, so it&#x27;s impossible to generate a bad key. Likewise, any 32-byte public key and any nonce is equivalent to any other in the sense of not compromising your own secret key when deriving a shared secret. Nothing depends on validation, where logic fundamental to the security of the code is sprinkled around the code in non-obvious places. Curve25519 is designed to be as fool-proof as possible.<p>There are exceptions, as always. And we can&#x27;t always write perfect software. But I think that best practice is generally that the secure and correct functioning of software SHOULD NOT rely on input validation. Period.","time":1493238776,"type":"comment"}],"parent":14199197,"text":"I disagree with the author.<p>&gt;The first thing you learn in any infosec class is to reject invalid inputs, and check return values for errors, even if there’s no obvious exploit in sight. Doing this is sometimes called “defense in depth” or “best practice”.<p>Rejected invalid inputs is often a good idea, but it isn&#x27;t defense in depth and it isn&#x27;t automatically best practice. Always doing something because you &quot;learned it an infosec class&quot; is dogmatic.<p>&gt;The point of Diffie-Hellman is that both key shares should equally contribute to the shared secret, so that the protocol doesn’t allow key control, a desirable attribute of any authenticated key agreement protocol, as discussed in this MQV paper. If the protocol allows a peer to force the shared secret to be zero, or more generally to lie in a subgroup, then the said peer can surreptitiously weaken the protocol’s security (objection: “but why would a peer be malicious?”).<p>This point was refuted earlier in the article. &quot;If a peer is malicious, than they can do much worse than sending invalid keys&quot;.<p>&gt; It’s costless: adding a zero check is ten lines of code tops, which is unlikely to introduce new vulnerabilities nor to hurt performance.<p>Ten lines of code isn&#x27;t costless, it is low cost. Even if it were costless, it would still be better to not do it unless there is a compelling reason to do it.<p>&gt; It reduces the risk of non-obvious attacks. Take Signal’s protocol, for example. If Alice generates all-zero prekeys and identity key, and pushes them to the Signal’s servers, then all the peers who initiate a new session with Alice will encrypt their first message with the same key, derived from all-zero shared secrets—essentially, the first message will be in the clear for an eavesdropper. Alice can deny being malicious, arguing that her PRNG failed. That’s just an example scenario—granted, far-fetched—but there might be others, and checking for invalid keys is probably easier than proving that they will never be exploited.<p>Not only is this not a &quot;non-obvious attack&quot;, this is the only possible attack. The only thing that adding a check to prevent a zero key can do is prevent someone from using a zero key. By the way, this attack gains nothing. Any malicious user already has the ability to publicize any messages sent to them.","time":1493184128,"type":"comment"}],"id":14199197,"score":18,"url":"https://research.kudelskisecurity.com/2017/04/25/should-ecdh-keys-be-validated/","by":"zdw"},"14214549":{"by":"seds","descendants":0,"id":14214549,"score":7,"time":1493325964,"title":"Nomx responds to Scott Helme's research","type":"story","url":"https://nomx.com/"},"14190736":{"time":1493093860,"type":"story","descendants":18,"title":"The legend of the Legion","kids":[{"by":"Hasknewbie","id":14197744,"parent":14190736,"text":"It feels like the author has decided, based on superficial views, that the Foreign Legion is uniquely a &quot;death cult&quot;, and then forced his narrative through the article.

The only way to do it right is to add each feature as if all your customers were going to use it, but instead, people cut corners and write features in such a way that they only support the targeted customer(s).  They compound the problem by adding special cases in the business logic to make sure the feature doesn&#x27;t affect other customers even though it&#x27;s broken for them.  They add features for one customer that aren&#x27;t even logically coherent for other customers.  They lower their sights from &quot;make this code work for every valid set of inputs&quot; to &quot;make this code work for all of our current customers, except the ones who won&#x27;t notice because they don&#x27;t use this feature yet.&quot;<p>The result is completely unmaintainable.

Practical example : I am building a community for programmers [1], so to get some initial feedback I posted to a Python subreddit and got the first 50 users. I got a lot of valuable feedback, but users hardly came back to my site after a couple of days. So I decided to follow up individually with users who had signed up and started a conversation about my site. I explained to each user what the site is about, how to use it and asked for feedback. I also asked them what their first impressions of the site were and how it can be improved. I learnt that people did not even understand what my site was about, and I knew that I need to focus on conveying the essence of the site to new users. (Still working on it) You gain a lot of insight about users by having conversations with individual users. I managed to help 3 people with their Python related problems so far, in the chat room <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.metalmanac.com&#x2F;topics&#x2F;python&#x2F;chat&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.metalmanac.com&#x2F;topics&#x2F;python&#x2F;chat&#x2F;</a><p>Once you get a small number of users who are passionate about your project, continue talking to individual users and ask them to share it with their friends and offer to guide each user individually, it works very well. This is obviously not scalable beyond a few hundred users, but getting those passionate users initially is critical. I am currently at this stage.<p>Once you have a group of 100 or so passionate users, you can share it with a wider community of users (eg- PH, HN for tech projects) and continue focusing on having conversations with individual users.<p>[0] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;paulgraham.com&#x2F;ds.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;paulgraham.com&#x2F;ds.html</a><p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.metalmanac.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.metalmanac.com&#x2F;</a>","time":1493106711,"type":"comment"},{"by":"r_singh","id":14192747,"parent":14191161,"text":"At my previous startup which was a home scrap pickup service in India, we acquired our first few hundred users with word of mouth, offline event participation (in an exhibition) and getting an article in a local newspaper.<p>The exact path to getting the users will differ based on what you&#x27;re attempting to do.

It&#x27;s that the risk of people flooding to your strategy and ruining ROI is low, so if you want to share it for some reason (e.g., contributing to the community, being nice), I don&#x27;t think you should worry.<p>Your example is artificial.  In attempting to justify a fear that I find overly common, you&#x27;ve provided an imaginary scenario where that fear <i>might</i> be justified.  I don&#x27;t think it addresses the argument well.  Plus, even in your example, I think the risks are low.  Lots of people have to read your comment, believe you&#x27;re telling the truth, <i>and</i> most importantly, be set up to quickly use the information to drive traffic to their own site.  Chances are their products aren&#x27;t exactly the same as yours, and the conversion rates might not be so high for them.  Many will anticipate this and not even try.  Everyone else will just extract the higher level &quot;insight&quot; from the keywords and move on.<p>I&#x27;ll share a story.  There is a very successful company called Ravean, they sell coats and sleeping bags with heated linings.  They&#x27;ve done several million on Kickstarter over the past few years.  The founder of Ravean did some interviews and explained his ad strategy.  He said initially he tried advertising with keywords targeting camping and outdoor consumers.  Eventually, after burning up 7 or 8 grand, he erased all his keywords and targeted crowdfunding enthusiasts with keywords like &quot;Kickstarter&quot;, &quot;Indiegogo&quot; and &quot;crowdfunding.&quot;  He claims his conversion rates jumped way, way up.  In the interviews, he says &quot;I should charge for this advice.&quot;  Now he <i>does</i> charge for it:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ravean.com&#x2F;crowdfunding&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ravean.com&#x2F;crowdfunding&#x2F;</a><p>So, even though there is a freely accessible interview, online, where this guy gives away his knowledge, he still makes money selling the same advice to other people.  There is such a sea of information out on the web that any one thing is very likely to get lost.<p>The Ravean advertising trick is as close to the scenario you mentioned, and here I am, sharing it with HN.  But how many people will really read this comment?  How many will be doing crowdfunding campaigns in the near future?  How many will immediately jump on the advice?  Will it move the CPC needle?

Does your son have an interest in something related to programming? How are your son&#x27;s reading, writing and typing skills? Programming, by nature, is very deliberate. Misspellings and typos can cause a world of hurt for an experienced dev and could be even more frustrating for a kid. A lot of programming is less about the language than it is about the concepts.<p>In light of the above, I am going to make an out of the box suggestion...<p>Buy a Lego Mindstorms kit. Build a robot with him and then use the software to put together basic programs for the robots with the programming software that is included. You will be able to teach him simple if statements, loops, conditionals, variables, etc all without having to worry about what language to use and without him worrying about spacing and punctuation.<p>When I was a kid I loved doing this. I was always playing with Mindstorms, setting up courses, and seeing if my programming lets them work their way out of them. I also would set up different courses for the two types of wheels that came with my kit. I had to learn that bumper sensors had to be out further than the wheels. I had to be able to turn on and off motors for the right length of time to make the robots turn. I could use light sensors and I even tried to figure out how to make it annoy my sister. There was some building, sure, but a lot of my time was spend &quot;programming&quot; with the Mindstorms software.<p>Then I tried to jump to C++ or C# (cannot remember) when I was 9-11 and I was miserable. Granted, my parents had no programming experience and I tried to kind of do it on my own, but it was a bit much for me. I just didn&#x27;t enjoy it and quickly left it alone.<p>If your son enjoys Mindstorms, maybe in 12-24 months you guys can start with real electronics and a formal programming language. The cool part is (especially if you have an interest) this (ie. hobby electronics and programming them) is something that could be something you do with your son that lasts a lifetime.

They&#x27;ve been shaped by our own past experiences and views of what&#x27;s important or useful at large.<p>Students, especially young students, are still forming their worldviews. It&#x27;s possible to condition them to think one way, but these views will always feel &quot;forced&quot; or &quot;alien&quot; compared to views they arrive at themselves.[^1]<p>Thus, it&#x27;s important that the students drives the learning. This is largely done by <i>perpetually asking questions</i>. Knowing the answer without being intimately aware of the question is nearly useless. Curious students will ask better questions, internalize the knowledge better, and drive their own learning.<p>As it turns out, this applies to all learning, not your specific question related to programming&#x2F;computing. Let&#x27;s explore that question next:<p>2. <i>Prioritize computational thinking.</i><p>Specific choice of languages in industry come and go. You identify this trend yourself: in recent years languages like Go and Elixer appear to be gaining popularity, perhaps even at the expense of languages like Ruby or Java. Whatever the general trend maybe, language choices always vary. However, there are two tenets which remain relatively constant.<p>a. <i>&quot;Computational Thinking&quot; provides a framework for problem solving</i><p>Computational Thinking, as popularized by Jeanette Wing[^2], basically just means thinking about solving problems in a way that formulating the solution resembles the process by which you could encode the solution on a computer. Regardless of the choice of language, programmers and computer scientists still approach problems algorithmically and formulaically. This skill set is more important than knowledge of any particular language.<p>b. <i>Language paradigms change infrequently</i><p>Across all the industrial trends in language choice, languages in popular use can largely be categorized by the extent to which they utilize two paradigms: the imperative paradigm, where programs are built of a series of state mutations, and the functional paradigm, where programs are built from mathematical functions with a focus on composition.<p>Familiarity with both of these paradigms is important, and indeed they complement each other.[^3][^4] Most languages are not purely functional nor purely imperative. However, being able to recognize and identify these features will facilitate learning new languages as they arise.<p>3. <i>Embrace child-like wonder.</i><p>As we get older, there&#x27;s increasing pressure to not be &quot;surprised.&quot; People say things like, &quot;Wait, you didn&#x27;t know that? Everyone knows that.&quot; As a result, we are conditioned to contain our excitement when learning new things.<p>As it turns out, people are learning and getting excited about things all the time. Excitement is infectious; if you are always excited and passionate about the things you&#x27;re learning (or teaching!), that excitement will spread to those around you.<p>&gt; <i>Never lose sight of that child-like wonder. It&#x27;s just too important. It&#x27;s what drives us.</i><p>&gt; -- Randy Pausch, <i>The Last Lecture</i><p>—————<p>[^1]: Cf.

But unlike sports teams, which get a sort of &#x27;natural reset&#x27; each season, companies do not.<p>The CEO position is perhaps the single largest point of leverage on the future success of a company. And while it is impossible to know when you hire a CEO if they will have a positive, neutral, or negative effect on the company, it is clear after a while how it is going. And having it be <i>that</i> important to hire a good one, ones that have a &#x27;proven&#x27; track record are going to be able to command a much better salary than one who doesn&#x27;t. Not because their decisions are more employee focused or shareholder focused, but because their decisions are the ones that are good for the success of the company as a whole.<p>And then how do those decisions effect the company? Well in three obvious ways; they affect the effectiveness of the company at getting things done (its productivity), they affect the number of markets in which the company can complete, or they affect the company&#x27;s focus. What is worse, in the midst of all these company critical factors they are trying to balance, they will have directors and VPs working for them who are <i>actively sabotaging</i> other directors and VPs efforts in an attempt to &#x27;get ahead.&#x27; It would be like playing chess where sometimes a pawn just decides on its own to capture the piece it can see to make itself look more important to the other pieces on the board with no appreciation for where those other pieces are situated or what part they are playing in the current board strategy.<p>The bottom line is that there is a spectrum of &#x27;CEO&#x27; from &#x27;CEO&#x27; of a 10 person startup (which is indistinguishable from a line manager) and &#x27;CEO&#x27; of a 100 person, 1K person, 10k person, and 100k person companies. Each order of magnitude changes the role in many ways. The one thing they all have in common is that they can destroy the company they are in charge of if they screw up or simply aren&#x27;t up to the task.","time":1493076300,"type":"comment"},{"by":"throwaway91111","id":14191093,"parent":14188044,"text":"It seems the second class is more valuable.

There are the ones that founded the company and have led the company according to their own personal vision.  Many of them hold stock worth billions and they&#x27;re generally looked up to as &quot;captains of industry&quot;.<p>The other kind is the CEO who is hired by the board of directors.  They&#x27;re usually very well paid and given a lot of stock, but aren&#x27;t wealthy the way, say, Bill Gates is wealthy.  They also tend not to be as admired, since they didn&#x27;t build the business from the ground up.<p>People wonder why the second class of CEO receives such lavish compensation, when they&#x27;re essentially just a regular employee.  I suspect that the compensation is actually part of the qualification for the job.  It makes shareholders feel good if the CEO holds a lot of stock, because it&#x27;s a strong incentive for them to put the interests of the shareholders (whom it&#x27;s easy to stereotype as rich, entitled lazy people living lavishly off of passive investment income) above the interests of the employees the CEO works with every day (who are usually hard-working people who, if the company is successful, generate far more wealth than they&#x27;re compensated for).<p>Normal human behavior would be to put the interests of the employees above the shareholders.  Large stock grants counteract that.  Sometimes I wonder if a hired CEO were to refuse to receive large stock grants, would that cause the shareholders to revolt and&#x2F;or the board of directors to not hire or try to fire him&#x2F;her, simply because they&#x27;re not comfortable with a CEO who doesn&#x27;t have an incentive to pump up the stock value.<p>(It&#x27;s worth noting that shareholders can change their investments much easier than employees can change employers, so shareholders are more likely to prefer policies that pump up the stock value now even if they&#x27;re bad for the company in the long run.)","time":1493066099,"type":"comment"},{"by":"JoeCortopassi","id":14188952,"kids":[{"by":"CountSessine","id":14189001,"kids":[{"by":"yeukhon","id":14191238,"parent":14189001,"text":"Interesting.

It is also sadly true that CEOs get most if not all the credit of what their teams accomplish even if they didn&#x27;t have much of a part in it.  The current CEO &quot;God&quot; Jobs said as much, and in fact had wrong intuitions on a number of the most critical things today in Apple&#x27;s business... a gigantic one being a hesitance to open up the iPhone to 3rd party apps.  I think other Apple team members eventually convinced Jobs (probably didn&#x27;t take that much effort) to open things up.  Jobs was rightfully concerned 3rd party apps could crash your phone which wasn&#x27;t a good idea!!<p>That said, when Apple didn&#x27;t have a strong product-focused leader we saw where it went earlier, and one can see how it&#x27;s floundering today -- under Cook, Apple was maybe 2 years or more late with a large screen phone and the iWatch is not good at all.  Tesla under a certain CEO has in less than 15 years what&#x27;s widely considered the world&#x27;s best car...beating few dozen companies with long histories of making cars and limitless resources.  Amazon took big risks with AWS, Prime, and many other things and failed miserably many times e.g. the Fire phone...but they have a leader who kept pushing things forward.

I was 24-25, enrolled in a Master&#x27;s program (easy enough to explain why I left without a job) living in a house that I was not paying rent for and had the full support of both my parents and my fiancé. I didn&#x27;t want to be a burden to my family. I was scared it would take me another 7 months to find a job like it did when I graduated from college in 2010. I had bills to pay. All of that was overwhelming <i>despite</i> me logically knowing I would be fine and that I wouldn&#x27;t starve or go homeless or miss a bill payment because my fiancé or parents had stated so.<p>I can only imagine the pressures he thought he faced at home if he felt like it was his responsibility to take care of his family. It was probably so overwhelming that he saw no other out.<p>It is hard to describe to someone who never experienced a job that is overwhelmingly and exclusively awful how much of an impact it makes on you. And I am not talking about a job that you don&#x27;t like or don&#x27;t enjoy. I mean a job that has zero redeeming qualities and a culture that is incredibly toxic. You feel like a failure at work. You are miserable. And you see an out (quitting) but if you quit (without a job) there are a whole bunch of questions. And in some ways those unknowns are even worse than the misery. But then you go back in the next day and go &quot;no way the prospect of losing my home can be worse than this.&quot; Then you go home and it is &quot;no way my job can be worse than losing my home and failing my wife and kids.&quot; And it both cases you realize that, yes, somehow, both of those statements are true. The job is more miserable than losing the home which is more miserable than the job which is more miserable than letting down my wife and kids which is more miserable than my job which is more miserable than...<p>... and suddenly you find yourself with a gun in the front seat of your car because there is nothing in life that is not miserable.

I didn&#x27;t kill myself, but I have to tell you, I could see how someone could.<p>In my circumstance I interviewed as a Senior Engineer, and got offered a Lead engineer position because apparently I had impressed everyone so much (this is important because later, they would claim I wasn&#x27;t even good enough to be a senior engineer). I erroneously thought that I would get support and encouragement, I got none of those things. Worse still I was the only black engineer in the entire company at that location, which left me incredibly isolated during my work days, when things got really really rough.<p>Essentially, 70 days into my tenure, despite 30 and 60 day reviews that seemed fine, my manager and architect of the codebase I worked on, decided I wasn&#x27;t up to snuff, and essentially started a process of managing me out of the company. My manager was a very smart engineer but a world class jerk, so when I complained to HR about the unfairness, he was demoted so that both of us were now leads, but guess what?<p>The Performance improvement process continued ... I got a new boss, but he just picked up where the other guy left off. The kicker?<p>He worked in another city so he actually got feedback on my performance from guess who? my new peer, who clearly now had an axe to grind.<p>Everything was downhill from there, everything I did was shit, everything. I remember going into work one day and my boss sending me an email that essentially said &quot;you&#x27;re not performing at lead engineer level, and you are not even at senior engineer level, if we&#x27;re being honest&quot;, great morale boost.<p>When I tried to ask for help (remember I&#x27;d never been a lead before) it was turned around as me trying to assign blame to other people. I had nobody to help me, and worse, I was the only black engineer at that location. I felt like and absolute failure everyday for 30 days (they had a 90 day introductory period, so they gave me an additional 30 days to &quot;prove&quot; myself, but in addition I had to agree to that Performance improvement plan, I mentioned earlier.<p>At one point, I was barely sleeping, was super stressed out and anxious, even on weekends. I&#x27;d go into meetings with my new boss, and the old one (remember he&#x27;s my peer now) with his superior knowledge of the code base (he built it) would throw me under the bus, claiming I wouldn&#x27;t hit my dates, or that my estimates were wrong. Openly, in front of 7 or 8 people, and the new boss would tolerate it.<p>To add to all this, I was on an h1b, and had left a job that was processing my green card to join this new company. So if I lost the job, I would be right back to square one with everything, and I&#x27;d have to find a job within 30 days. Throw that in the mix with being told everyday that I was crap, not having anyone at work to talk to about what was going on, being on a performance improvement plan and walking around totally humiliated wondering what everyone must think of the dumb black engineer who couldn&#x27;t even hack it a couple of months.<p>Anyway, the final straw came when I delivered my project pretty much on time, but my boss changed his tune from &quot;poor performance&quot; to &quot;culture fit&quot;. I had known the game was rigged and I was just being managed out, but at that moment I knew it for a fact, and asked to be allowed to give 2 weeks notice, but spend the 2 weeks at home not working for the company, but looking for a job.<p>They agreed to that, and I was gone.<p>But that wasn&#x27;t the end of that. turns out that at the end of that 2 weeks they had my h1b revoked (usually companies will let it sit a few weeks, especially if they know you&#x27;re looking for work). This meant that when I landed a job 30 days later, my visa couldn&#x27;t be transferred, and the company had to take back their offer, and move on.<p>If not for an amazing lawyer who worked some black magic to get my green card 8 months later, (I had an approved i140 from an earlier job, but didn&#x27;t realize the significance of that, turns out, its VERY significant). I really don&#x27;t know what I would have done.<p>Those 8 months were truly some dark times, I left the job in October, and let me tell you, being out of work over holidays is no joke, everyone is out making plans and traveling to see family, and there you are contemplating the epic shit your life has become, almost overnight. In addition to failing so badly at a job I desperately wanted to succeed in, I couldn&#x27;t work for 8 months, and even worse, didn&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d be allowed to stay in the country. I was pretty depressed, but I had a group of engineering friends that helped me keep my spirits up, and listened to my rants (no idea how they put up with it honestly), and I think the biggest thing was that a good friend of mine (pretty much my sister), got me into therapy. That was MASSIVE.<p>If not for that ... who the fuck knows.<p>So yeah ... I can totally see the cascade of events that lead to this mans death, I lay the blame squarely at the feet of horrible management, as was the case for me. I wouldn&#x27;t be shocked to find that he was placed on a performance improvement plan, and just ... gave up.<p>PS: I&#x27;m a bit of a fighter, I don&#x27;t shirk from an argument, and I&#x27;ll call bs when I see it. This has got me in trouble at a couple of places I&#x27;ve worked, but ironically, thats probably something that helped me power through the absolute disgrace of an experience that I went through.

After a while, channels begin to form and the ink naturally starts to flow down the channels, deepening them. It&#x27;s pretty obvious that (a) knowing you are stuck in a groove takes some insight and (b) breaking out of the thought patterns can be pretty challenging.<p>De Bono also invented the L game. The interesting thing about this game is that it demonstrates very visually a flaw in human thinking: once you have started down a path in a decision tree and pruned off other possibilities, all your answers from that point onwards will be wrong if that path doesn&#x27;t contain the right answer.<p>Pretty obvious, but where the flaw comes in is that, unlike computers, humans don&#x27;t tend to backtrack past a point of a belief that &quot;this is axiomatic&quot;, and never reexamine it.<p>I think that - and this is just IMHO - people who go on to commit suicide when there are other, obviously better solutions, are stuck deep down the wrong branch of a decision tree and incapable of reevaluating prior decisions.<p>Offering rational advice to people in this position is futile; what&#x27;s needed is to help them pour warm ink to form new channels.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Po-Beyond-Yes-Edward-Bono&#x2F;dp&#x2F;0140137823\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Po-Beyond-Yes-Edward-Bono&#x2F;dp&#x2F;01401378...</a>","time":1493187725,"type":"comment"},{"by":"pdimitar","dead":true,"id":14203177,"kids":[{"by":"guiomie","id":14203259,"kids":[{"by":"pdimitar","id":14203284,"kids":[{"by":"guiomie","id":14206400,"kids":[{"by":"pdimitar","id":14207856,"parent":14206400,"text":"I think we&#x27;re not that far off but you seem to generalize a bit.<p>It&#x27;s not about being weak or relying on your partner to think or act <i>for you</i>.<p>There&#x27;s a huge distance between &quot;being dependent, passive, unable to fix my own problems&quot; and &quot;being on the brink of suicide&quot; however.
