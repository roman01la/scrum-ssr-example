It&#x27;s crucial to note that <i>there is no backpressure mechanism at work here</i> -- reducing housing options for people with the least money will not cause the construction of housing that meets those standards. Mandating luxury does not work without mandating supply as well. Such zoning laws ended SROs and rooming houses (by prohibiting any new construction) and such drastic reductions in the cheapest housing options, of course, caused homelessness crises.<p>&gt; The goal of banning tenements is to prevent companies from exploiting people and profiting from them -- building tenements actually takes society away from the solution, by wasting land and money that could have been spent on housing.<p>Yes. Land-owners indeed inherently &quot;profit&quot; from people, as owning land lets them charge rents.

The code didn’t say the rooms had to be tied together as a single unit, so Potter built a cross between an apartment building and a boardinghouse, where someone could rent a sleeping room as small as 100 square feet with a private bath and share a kitchen with up to seven others renters.<p>&gt; A micro-housing building spree ensued that gave Seattle more such units than any city in the country. At last count, 782 micro-housing units were cleared for occupancy in Seattle, with another 1,598 units in the pipeline. No other American city comes close.<p>&gt; Once the pipeline is cleared, though, no future Potter-style hybrids will be allowed: The city changed the rules in October after neighbors railed against the projects. Congregate housing — group housing arrangements such as dorms and senior housing that use common areas — is still allowed.

It&#x27;s common to see someone take a secure random int and try to fit it into a constrained range. There is no easy way to do this without shifting off entire bits!!! Modulo operations produce biased results unless your constrained range is a power of two. This is a consequence of binary number representation and you can&#x27;t work around it without a lot of gymnastics or using simple discard to throw away all the generated numbers outside your desired range.<p>If you absolutely must have a constrained and securely random int the easiest way to do it is bitshift down to the closest power of two then discard any numbers outside the range. This is fairly quick, never discards more than half your numbers, and doesn&#x27;t mess with the randomness of the distribution.<p>Another one, the difference between a secure hash like SHA and HMAC is extremely dangerous. Possibly the most common and dangerous cryptographic mistake by anyone that isn&#x27;t just incompetent.<p>I see the majority of developers using hashes based on Merkle Damgard construction such as MD5 and SHA1&#x2F;2 . When these hashes are being used to verify integrity of anything user supplied they can be trivially attacked using length extension. These attacks are real and one even happened to Flickr a couple years back.\n<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;netifera.com&#x2F;research&#x2F;flickr_api_signature_forgery.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;netifera.com&#x2F;research&#x2F;flickr_api_signature_forgery.pd...</a>\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Merkle–Damgård_construction\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Merkle–Damgård_construction</a> .<p>Look at the terrifying list of &quot;other vulnerable APIS&quot;, some big names in there. When using these types of hashes YOU MUST USE HMAC. It&#x27;s slower but the bare algorithm is unsafe in many (most?) real world applications and I have no idea why language designers make them available so everyone can screw up their crypto.<p>A third one is more of a fun crypto hack, but on some platforms you really don&#x27;t trust the RNG. You can make up for this somewhat by getting a single secure random input from a person then generating more numbers by encrypting the same string to itself over and over.<p>It used to be uncool to generate random numbers using AES because of the &quot;entropy pool&quot; concept. Eventually everyone realized this was nonsense and now RNG&#x27;s are.much faster :)","time":1493538262,"type":"comment"}],"id":14230482,"score":5,"url":"https://littlemaninmyhead.wordpress.com/2017/04/22/top-10-developer-crypto-mistakes/","by":"r4um"},"14230818":{"by":"wheresvic1","descendants":0,"id":14230818,"score":2,"time":1493546063,"title":"Show HN: Long-term investment ideas","type":"story","url":"https://smalldata.tech/sd-insights/investment-ideas"},"14230163":{"by":"bane","descendants":0,"id":14230163,"score":2,"time":1493526540,"title":"Tyler Cowen Discusses “An Economist Gets Lunch”","type":"story","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjbXa2YbvgY"},"14230728":{"by":"sachinbharmoria","descendants":0,"id":14230728,"score":2,"time":1493542817,"title":"Universal Guide to Install Any Version of Windows OS","type":"story","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGO88awqQLs"},"14230963":{"by":"pizza","descendants":0,"id":14230963,"score":2,"time":1493549729,"title":"Adam Curtis – Hierarchy in the UK, Anarchy in Kurdistan (2014)","type":"story","url":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/adamcurtis/entries/5a7b18b5-0ec3-3d3e-a307-54820a7c6a59"},"14230105":{"by":"Yahmed2","descendants":0,"id":14230105,"score":1,"time":1493524711,"title":"The Optician's Guide to AR/VR","type":"story","url":"https://www.smartvisionlabs.com/blog/the-opticians-guide-to-ar-and-vr/"},"14230235":{"by":"ramoq","descendants":0,"id":14230235,"score":1,"time":1493528622,"title":"S-400","type":"story","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-400_missile_system"},"14231097":{"by":"taspeotis","descendants":0,"id":14231097,"score":3,"time":1493552690,"title":"Microsoft Trademarks Direct Physics – Is This a New Physics API for DirectX 12?","type":"story","url":"http://wccftech.com/microsoft-trademarks-direct-physics-dx12/"},"14230795":{"by":"pareshverma91","descendants":0,"id":14230795,"score":1,"text":"Consider the following search results: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;TYym7 (same thing flobots lyrics) and http:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;mAqjM (believer imagine dragons lyrics).

Free access to academic research makes the world a more equitable place, and rigorous and efficient peer review accelerates the pace of scientific and scholarly research.<p>Academia launched in 2008, and now around 35 million people use the site a month. Around 19 million papers have been uploaded, and are freely available on the platform. Forty percent of Academia’s users are from developing countries and would otherwise have limited access to academic research.<p>In order to achieve Academia’s goals, Academia is working to become a sustainable operation. In order to do that, we introduced Academia Premium, which includes extra features such as Readers, Mentions, Expanded Analytics and Advanced Search.<p>- Readers tells you who is reading your papers<p>- Mentions alerts you when papers are uploaded mentioning your name<p>- Expanded Analytics provides a more detailed look at what kinds of people visit your profile and how people find your papers<p>- Advanced Search allows you to find exact keyword matches in the full text of every paper on Academia<p>In considering what features to offer in the Premium account, we decided that features related to the mission of the company should be free. This means that features related to open access (free access to uploading and downloading papers), and features related to peer review (sessions, recommendations) are free. As we add new features to Premium, we will continue to ensure that features related to the mission (open access, sessions, recommendations) are free.<p>We are grateful to all the academics who have contributed to Academia, and we will continue to serve academics from around the world.","time":1493567897,"type":"comment"},{"by":"digitalzombie","id":14231438,"kids":[{"by":"vog","id":14231535,"kids":[{"by":"mks40","id":14231599,"kids":[{"by":"GoodbyeEarl","id":14233050,"kids":[{"by":"mks40","id":14233113,"parent":14233050,"text":"Upon further consideration, I suspect this was a very intentional move and not just a growth effect, because they could just as well have kept moderation strict.<p>People do like to answer questions and be acknowledged for their know-how, but what people love is to talk about themselves and have their experiences validated.<p>Sure, Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook give a way to have your social existence acknowledged, but Quora offers anyone to have their individual life experiences validated, no matter if they have the lifestyle or looks typically associated with social media fame.

So they think you&#x27;re not qualified for a Frontend dev or mobile or backend job.

Reading the job description they&#x27;re looking for a lead web engineer. Going throught their interview process, %90 of the evaluation revolves around writting pseudo code on a whiteboard for hours. Talking about trees and linkedlists. Do you see the problem? They are looking for an experienced engineer with a huge track record, but they use college stuff to evaluate their candidates. If you&#x27;re fresh out of school you could crack the interview but you&#x27;re not even qualified and vice versa. That is the broken piece.<p>I think companies are moving towards eliminating the Resume.

Linux isn&#x27;t overall a bastion of best practices nowadays (sadly) but it was started as &quot;just another hobby project&quot; that happened to go viral (in the 90s, no less).<p>But even before that, UNIX itself was purely academic and its designers retained the &quot;information wants to be free&quot; mentality, continuing to quietly release updates via tape even after the licensing wars began.<p>But besides all of that, sitting around all day and figuring things out without commercial focus (at least initially) - basically just having fun being creative - can be the most educational. Oh, and fun. :D (I&#x27;ve only just recently figured this out...)<p>&gt; <i>But I think the world of computing would be a much better place if we went microkernel.

I can&#x27;t help but wonder if it was a case of &quot;it was easier for me to do it that way, shhhhhh&quot;, or what. QNX is a microkernel that also offers hard real-time guarantees. I find it difficult to believe that microkernels do not offer practical performance in the face of such capability. But then again, I&#x27;m admittedly not an OS expert. (Although <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Talk%3ANanokernel\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Talk%3ANanokernel</a> - thanks Google for showing me the talk page instead of the article! haha - cleared things up nicely.)<p>I can very easily understand microkernels being more stable and reliable.

Depending on how long ago you did this (sounds like it was a while ago - not sure when QNX went 32-bit) you might remember quite a bit if you tried to do it again.<p>And if you did, you&#x27;ve already done the &quot;re-do QNX, fixing all the less-than-ideal bits that couldn&#x27;t be identified as such at design time&quot; thing - so you&#x27;d be going over it <i>a second time</i>, with potentially even more refined results.<p>&gt; <i>But an open source version of it would make big inroads into all kinds of embedded systems. But good luck getting the likes of NVIDIA to make a driver.</i><p>Eheheheh. The situation is not nearly that negative now! :D<p>First, you target Intel. This is simply tedious: there are real specifications floating around, along with a full GPLv2&#x27;d implementation in Linux that &quot;just&quot; needs normalizing (basically, distilling KMS and DRM out of the picture). As you go along, you may be able to get some assistance - Intel recently said hello to FreeBSD: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=13848258\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=13848258</a>, and I think you could describe QNX to be sort of on the same spectrum&#x2F;track as an OS ecosystem in some ways, so that might translate to not-entirely-closed-doors where&#x2F;when it would count. HD Graphics is a huge win to have available; many embedded systems (:D :D) don&#x27;t have discrete GPUs, and the on-chip GPU specifies two video heads (IIRC), can handle 1080p+, and generally from the standpoint of &quot;reimplement QNX&quot; provides an overkill level of hardware capacity&#x2F;capability. It would be more than enough to get in the door of making a serious MVP (that&#x27;s actually usable), if you will.<p>With some kind of established thing going on with Intel, work would begin to try and target AMD, specifically the APUs. This is likely where the NDAs would start, but it would be viable to do so because a) AMD would be able to see the Intel-only situation and want to compete and b) I expect there would be some sort of commercial thing with the OS happening at this point (eg, the MVP attracting some bites, either from VCs or industry) helping things along.<p>From there, it&#x27;d be a matter of going &quot;hey NVIDIA...?&quot; and either waiting 2E14 years^W ^W for a port or getting specs to help out.<p>I realize I&#x27;ve naïvely just described a very high-level timeline involving tens of man-decades of development, a noteworthily large team, and probably a 7 figure budget. Sounds like a ridiculous amount of fun :)<p>I&#x27;ll also admit that my experience with C is not quite where I&#x27;d like it to be, and I&#x27;ve never written about an OS before so I&#x27;d have no idea where to start.<p>But I&#x27;m game if you ever feel like doing this at some point. I was thinking of maybe making a website (hmm, what to call it - I have no idea) so people could have a hub&#x2F;point of reference to point to and figure out what to work on and stuff.<p>That being said, no rush; this sounds like a fun idea, best to keep it that way.

Sound, video, I&#x2F;O... file system... SMP... C++ GUI... POSIX... threads. Took 6 years (1994-2000). <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;AtheOS\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;AtheOS</a><p>Eventually the project was abandoned, but in 2002 a small group of enterprising developers took AtheOS&#x27; GPL&#x27;d codebase (\\o&#x2F;) and built Syllable from it: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Syllable_Desktop\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Syllable_Desktop</a>, <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;syllable.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;syllable.org</a>. They tidied up the UI a bit, added USB support and other things, and make slow progress forward.<p>Now, Syllable is certainly not QNX. But I wanted to say this: the person (or group) who does the sprint and gets to the point of &quot;ok, it&#x27;s out there now&quot; doesn&#x27;t have to be the same group that eventually maintains everything. It&#x27;s an interesting idea to weigh up, because it instantly puts an upper bound on total development time. That time might be years, but 5-6 years is not eg 20 years. (Methinks it&#x27;ll be interesting to hear Linus reflect on kernel development after he&#x27;s retired and can say what he really wants to, and can step back far enough to consider all of his ~40+ years of involvement.)<p>Now, sure, with a &quot;sprint then step back&quot; approach it&#x27;s impossible that there won&#x27;t be disappointment and frustration with the way some things end up being done by the new gatekeepers, but if the implementation is sketched out sufficiently well and the time is taken to get the fundamentals (and the thousands of little things) correct, that could well mitigate the worst of that problem.<p>The reason I say all this is because I noticed <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=14230456\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=14230456</a> which pointed to <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lobste.rs&#x2F;s&#x2F;ensbd6&#x2F;building_blackberry_qnx_7_desktop#c_bpjfb3\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lobste.rs&#x2F;s&#x2F;ensbd6&#x2F;building_blackberry_qnx_7_desktop...</a>, which said at the bottom:<p>&gt; <i>I’m with Animats that it’s surprising that nobody is cloning QNX in these microkernel projects given it’s architecture is open.

It would be an interesting nut to crack, because license changes (at least after public releases) are inelegant, and always run the risk of compromising confidence. This would take some interesting discussion: I personally hate the GPLv3, for example, but &quot;GPLv3 or contact us&quot; might be attractive to interests that need to draft a license from scratch (at least ideologically - of course a commercial license template would be filed away).<p>Another very attractive benefit I see is that everyone would be able to debate the finer points of QNX&#x27;s existing design as implemented, and debate what parts of the design are worth copying and what should be reconsidered.

When you say &quot;open-source reimplementation of QNX that does X, Y and Z,&quot; you get to run with the existing context. So, rebuilding QNX could be sane in that regard.<p>But... Haiku&#x27;s binary compatibility <i>almost</i> feels like a committee meeting for the sake of meeting now. Haiku is locked to GCC 2.95 (and had to backport a bunch of critical fixes in order for that to be viable), doesn&#x27;t support BeOS R5 on PPC aka the BeBox (which is understandable, but notable), a bunch of private APIs aren&#x27;t going to be implemented, and <i>for all that</i>, only a handful of applications work.

But the kind of apps running on QNX are the kind that you generally want to be able to leave running for a few years knowing there won&#x27;t be a scheduling glitch anytime soon - the margins with QNX are <i>a lot</i> tigher than BeOS ever was.<p>:v<p>I need to go out now and I want to post this now instead of when I get back in a few hours, so I&#x27;ll leave it there.<p>I can envisage that redoing QNX might be a &quot;...dude.

It was so good that everything else felt (and still feels) both sluggish and cumbersome by comparison. Imagine an OS that <i>never</i> freezes, one that allows you to restart device drivers and upgrade them on running systems. Use remote resources as if they are local. Control hardware in real time from the same machine that runs your desktop. What held it back is that the company that sold it (Quantum Software in Montreal, Canada) wanted to charge for every bit that left their premises and for a long time it looked as if that strategy was going to win them the race.<p>Then FREEBSD86 happened and suddenly a lot of router vendors had an alternative, then came Minix and finally Linux. Now none of those three are as good at what QNX does best: hard real time, message passing, clustering. So the fit for these other OS&#x27;s to occupy QNX&#x27;s niche was never a good one. And so Quantum stayed alive a little longer. I petitioned them for a 32 bit version when they were still fully behind their 16 bit OS and refused to even consider making a 32 bit version because their old product was selling well and because backwards compatibility must have been a hard nut to crack for them.<p>So, in about 2 years I wrote a kernel that lifted the userland mostly from minix and linux. Added a network stack and if not for some unfortunate affairs it would have been released as open source.<p>In a way I&#x27;m happy that never happened because I would have been the slave of the rest of the world maintaining that. It&#x27;s one thing to push an application into the world, those things have a life-span. But an operating system will easily outlive its creators. The fact that Quantum was super aggressive when it came to IP also didn&#x27;t help the chances of a release.<p>Every day your life is touched by 100&#x27;s if not 1000&#x27;s of instances of QNX still quietly chugging away somewhere in the belly of the systems that keep our infrastructure working.<p>I&#x27;d love to see a 64 bit open sourced version of QNX take over, there is really no substitute for an OS with a sense of time.

Does anyone know someone who knows someone [...] who might be able to unearth &quot;the right person to talk to&quot; at BlackBerry about QNX? While I&#x27;d probably want to defer the actual conversation to a person (or small group) more familiar with QNX from real-world experience in industry, my motivation behind adding this point is the hope that there may still be some glimmer of interest in a shared-source model, and that - and I really hope this - the source-access shutdown was simply due to insufficient time to refine the contracts (because the buyout was executed at a particularly fast-moving instant in time). My thinking is that BlackBerry doesn&#x27;t realize the QNX enthusiast community exists <i>because they were shut down</i>, and that if BlackBerry could be made aware of the fact that there are still big fans out there, it might be a simple matter of adding a couple clauses to some super-high-level document to eg re-allow academic access. (Yes, this point has a lot of naïveté in it, but one can dream, right?)<p>1a. As a continuation of the above question, if I had a question&#x2F;notation for BlackBerry&#x2F;QNX, it would be this: a) QNX had a shared-source release, and seemed to be making good progress with that (in short, people weren&#x27;t running off with the code); b) the automotive industry and other large interests sound like fairly stable considerations for QNX; could this affect (a) in the future in any way? If this <i>were</i> possible, would it be possible for Photon to be included (perhaps with no warranty or code updates)?<p>2.

Since 1971 gold, along with every other commodity, has been optionalized. It doesn&#x27;t matter where or how it exists because what actually gets traded are options on the commodity. Now every once and a while somebody does actually take delivery but delivery is <i>very</i>, <i>very</i> costly and complicated for physical goods. Physical delivery involves not just the conveyance and storage fees but also the costs of integrity checks -- that is, literally going through each unit and verifying that what&#x27;s delivered satisfies some standard.<p>What the Federal Reserve has always been doing since it let foreign nations deposit gold for safe keeping is running a very inefficient options market. Gold is transferred in and  <i>very</i> modest storage fees are assessed each year (essentially the gold is stored <i>for free</i> [1]). Note that there are no real provisions for transferring the gold back out, this must be negotiated on a case-by-case basis. It is by all accounts a costly and tiresome thing to do.<p>Now the real question is -- why would any foreign government participate in such a scheme? And the answer is because it&#x27;s very beneficial for them. They get free gold storage in the safest vault in the world. And they don&#x27;t &quot;lose&quot; that wealth -- the NY Federal Reserve&#x27;s word is in fact &quot;good as gold&quot; and so that wealth can be leveraged much more efficiently than lugging around and cutting up actual gold bars. What does the United States get out of it? In fact it&#x27;s not so clear. Some politicians have reasonably asked why we&#x27;re paying a bunch of money to store ~7,000 tons of other people&#x27;s gold below Manhattan. It doesn&#x27;t really make much sense except that, well, it&#x27;s now been &quot;policy&quot; for 50 years and changing is very difficult and expensive.<p>In the end nobody really cares. There&#x27;s nothing suspicious going on. The author&#x27;s &quot;reading&quot; that Germany has forfeited 1200 tons of gold because they&#x27;re not allowed to &quot;count the gold&quot; is beyond ridiculous. The rationale for leaving gold in the Fed and moving slips of paper around is pretty sound -- it&#x27;s called modern banking. It&#x27;s mostly worked for 500 years. And the idea that gold will act as a reasonable substitute when the dollar collapses is just dumb. Because this is the thing that gold bugs never seem to understand: when&#x2F;if the dollar collapses it won&#x27;t be an isolated event. The implication is that the productive capacity of the USA has been zeroed out. Think about what events might cause this and ask yourself if, at this point, Germany (or anybody&#x27;s) biggest problem will be missing gold.<p>The article is painfully ignorant. The idea that it&#x27;s the gold buried under Manhattan that makes the dollar the reserve currency is not even wrong.<p>That said, if Germany does really want its gold the right thing to do would be for the Fed to make them pay standard market rates plus a Fed premium. Considering some banks charge as much as $300 an oz for such a delivery such a transaction would actually knock quite a bit off the national debt.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newyorkfed.org&#x2F;aboutthefed&#x2F;goldvault.html#storingthegold\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newyorkfed.org&#x2F;aboutthefed&#x2F;goldvault.html#storin...</a>","time":1493563674,"type":"comment"}],"parent":14231297,"text":"These may be reasonable propositions (or were when they applied, especially in the cases of a) and c)), but if and only if one assumes the deposits are effectively on call, and apparently they are not.<p>Your last sentence gets close to the key issue: if there is an innocent explanation, why have the parties who could remove the doubt over that explanation stopped talking about the issue?","time":1493560811,"type":"comment"}],"parent":14231235,"text":"No, not really. The &quot;nothing is amiss&quot; argument goes like this:<p>a) Until 1971, gold <i>was</i> regularly moved between central banks. The United States exchanged U.S. Dollars against gold and Germany made use of this. Obviously, it was easiest to just leave the gold where it was bought - in the United States. This was also where a lot of other central banks had (and still have) their gold, so it also made exchanges easier.<p>b) <i>After</i> 1971, trading gold might have become less frequent, and at the moment the Bundesbank states it does not sell or buy any gold at all. But still: Look at Switzerland who has sold a lot of their gold after they joined the IMF. By selling gold out of the US Fed vault, they could offer delivery at the US Fed, avoiding a lot of logistical hassle. Maybe the Bundesbank just wants to keep this option open, even though they don&#x27;t use it right now. It would be stupid to ship all the gold to Frankfurt, then decide to sell it in a couple of years from now, and then having to ship it back to the U.S. for the buyer.<p>c) Until 1989, it made sense to store gold outside of Europe to avoid it falling into the hands of the Soviet Union should they decide to invade (as suggested elsewhere in this discussion).<p>d) After 1989 and until recently, no one really cared about this topic. So it was easiest to just leave the gold where it was. Moving gold <i>is</i> a complicated business. The Bloomberg article linked above really makes it seem easier than it is. Yes, gold doesn&#x27;t take up much space, but because it is so valuable you can&#x27;t just put tons of gold into one plane &#x2F; ship &#x2F; truck - no one will sell you insurance for such a huge risk. You need to transport it in smaller batches, organizing secure transport and insurance for them, keeping the transports as secret as possible for security reasons. Also, you need to have sufficient storage available at the location where you want the gold to end up. And - again - you don&#x27;t want to store all of the stuff in a single space because you won&#x27;t get insurance for too much gold in one building.<p>I am not sure which explanation is the right one.
