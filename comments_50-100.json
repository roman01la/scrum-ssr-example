Deep learning is not separate from or a more evolved form of machine learning. It&#x27;s a learning algorithm, with its own structural biases, such as from architecture and optimization method. There is a duality between optimization&#x2F;search and sampling, they&#x27;re two sides of the same coin. Instead of giving labels, I prefer thinking about shared&#x2F;unshared properties and assumptions of the algorithm. Deep learning is unique in its ability to use gradients and credit assignment through a hierarchy when possible.<p>Deep learning, like all learners, must take assumptions and there are trade-offs. You trade time spent thinking up features (which reduce learning time and improve sample efficiency), for time thinking up architectures and the appropriate biases (graph conv, rnn, convnet, etc). Though still limited to a particular domain, you hope to gain an architecture that works with broader applicability than a feature based method. You also add more complex training, longer experimentation waits and gain a level of indirection between the problem and the learning algorithm. This means that the gains from new knowledge and understanding of a domain filter through slower for deep learning.<p>In deep learning, it&#x27;s a very experimental science. Theory is usually after the fact and not very filling. People try this or that and then write a show and tell paper, but knowledge still helps.

I use each container as a &quot;miniature VM&quot; which runs the entire web app (except the database), blasphemous I know. Compared to putting multiple apps on one box, the Docker method adds some minor complexity, but keeps apps isolated. That was my biggest requirement, to prevent devs from cross-pollinating applications, which happened constantly when everything was on a single server. It was much simpler than setting up Puppet on a bunch of legacy machines. I also considered putting each new app on its own VM, but went with Docker because a lot of our apps hardly get any traffic and would have wasted quite a bit of resources to spin up a VM for each (all our servers are in house).<p>The pros to Docker so far:\nDependencies: Dockerfile gives a list of explicit system dependencies for each app. This can be done in other ways with package files or config management but this was not being done before and this is an easy catch all to force it for any different type of environment.\nLogical Grouping: App environment (Dockerfile + docker-compose.yml) lives alongside codebase in a single git repo\nDeployment: Deploy to any box with `git clone myapp &amp;&amp; docker-compose up` for testing&#x2F;dev instances or migrations \nDevelopment: We mount the codebase from a host directory into each container, with git hooks to update the codebase, which works well for us (we have no CI)\nPlus it&#x27;s fun!<p>Cons:\nOperational Complexity: Devs&#x2F;Ops teams probably won&#x27;t want to learn a new tool. I setup a Rancher instance to provide a GUI which makes things a bit easier to swallow. It has things like a drop in shell, log viewer, performance metrics, etc. \nNetwork complexity: we never needed reverse proxies before, now we do.\nClustering&#x2F;Orchestration: We don&#x27;t cluster our containers, but the more we add the more I think we might want to, which would add a whole new layer of complexity to the mix and seems unnecessary for such a small shop.\nSecurity?: lots of unknowns, lack of persistence can be bad for forensics, etc.\nNewness: Documentation isn&#x27;t great, versions change fast, online resources may be outdated.<p>Like you, I&#x27;m sometimes unsure if this is the right choice.

If you remove that container or destroy the host, the volume persists and you can recreate the container on a new host and re-attach it to the associated volume (automatically).<p>As far as databases and horizontal scaling, this could probably be done currently within each Docker container at the database layer as you mentioned (CockroachDB also comes to mind).

You can add more containers as cockroachDB nodes, each with their own persistent+redundant storage, and you get all the DB sharding etc across nodes from cockroachDB while the redundancy+persistence are handled by Docker (plus storage solution) as far as restarting,  migrating, reconnecting, etc. This probably has all sorts of problems I&#x27;m blind to but that&#x27;s my rudimentary understanding.<p>Handling horizontal scaling, sharding etc  at the storage layer directly through Docker sounds much much harder, and I don&#x27;t even know what I&#x27;ve been talking about so far so I&#x27;ll leave it at that<p>Here&#x27;s a list of some people doing persistent Docker storage :<p><pre><code>  Flocker\n  Portworx https:&#x2F;&#x2F;portworx.com&#x2F;\n  StorageOS https:&#x2F;&#x2F;storageos.com&#x2F;\n  Rancher Longhorn https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rancher&#x2F;longhorn\n  Quobyte https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.quobyte.com&#x2F;containers\n  Nexenta https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nexenta.com&#x2F;solutions&#x2F;containers\n  Infinit https:&#x2F;&#x2F;infinit.sh&#x2F;docker\n  EMC REX-ray https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;codedellemc&#x2F;rexray\n  Ceph\n  Gluster\n  Mesos https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mesosphere.github.io&#x2F;marathon&#x2F;docs&#x2F;external-volumes.html\n  Kubernetes https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kubernetes.io&#x2F;docs&#x2F;concepts&#x2F;storage&#x2F;persistent-volumes&#x2F;\n  vSAN\n  Nutanix http:&#x2F;&#x2F;next.nutanix.com&#x2F;t5&#x2F;Nutanix-Connect-Blog&#x2F;Containers-Enter-the-Acropolis-Data-Fabric&#x2F;ba-p&#x2F;11122\n  Netapp (Docker volume plugins for SolidFire+ONTAP+E-series)\n  AWS EBS&#x2F;EFS</code></pre>","time":1493401540,"type":"comment"},{"by":"regularfry","id":14218317,"parent":14216969,"text":"The problem is that the constraints of wanting your data and CPU on the same node, needing data synced to more than one node, and avoiding being too much of a performance bottleneck, all combine to make it <i>very</i> hard to do better than something which has privileged knowledge of how the database works under the hood.

More specifically, it only restores the usual precedence behavior.<p>Most people don&#x27;t set the DT_RPATH ELF tag. It&#x27;s usually considered best practice to NOT set DT_RPATH. And that&#x27;s generally good advice, except that advice assumes absolute paths. Most people aren&#x27;t familiar with $ORIGIN, which allows using relative rpaths. In any event, my point is that most environments already allow LD_LIBRARY_PATH. If it&#x27;s been restricted then --enable-new-dtags won&#x27;t change that.<p>What --enable-new-dtags actually does is set DT_RUNPATH instead of DT_RPATH. DT_RPATH has higher precedence than LD_LIBRARY_PATH; DT_RUNPATH has lower precedence.<p>To reiterate, DT_RPATH and DT_RUNPATH are independent of LD_LIBRARY_PATH, and don&#x27;t effect whether it&#x27;s permitted or not. I recommend --enable-new-dtags to avoid confusion and unintentional side-effects.<p>I&#x27;ve known about $ORIGIN for awhile, but only recently hit upon --enable-new-dtags. I was hacking on a project recently ported to and packaged for CentOS 7. The relevant components were a Lua C module (acme.foo) binding a shared library (libacme-foo). The in-tree unit and regression tests used LUA_PATH, LUA_CPATH, and LD_LIBRARY_PATH so the in-tree objects were loaded instead of any that might happen to be installed on the system. I was adding some debugging code to the shared library and running `make check`, but my changes didn&#x27;t seem to be coming through in the tests. I was totally confused.<p>After far too much wasted time, I eventually realized that CentOS 7&#x27;s base Lua 5.1 package was built with an embedded rpath of &#x2F;usr&#x2F;lib64. A version of the package I was hacking on was already installed on the system. So &#x2F;usr&#x2F;lib64&#x2F;libacme-foo.so was linked when dlopen&#x27;ing the Lua C module instead of the in-tree libacme-foo.so that should have been found with LD_LIBRARY_PATH. That&#x27;s how I became familiar with the precedence of rpath and LD_LIBRARY_PATH, and the availability of the --enable-new-dtags option.<p>I&#x27;m not sure why Red Hat built their core Lua 5.1 binary with an rpath, but they almost certainly should have used --enable-new-dtags when doing so. Notably, &#x2F;usr&#x2F;bin&#x2F;perl on CentOS 7 is built with --enable-new-dtags; it has DT_RUNPATH=&#x2F;usr&#x2F;lib64&#x2F;perl5&#x2F;CORE.

But you can probably deploy static-linked\n  executables more easily than setting up docker.\n</code></pre>\nFor various reasons static linking isn&#x27;t a good idea for C applications. glibc doesn&#x27;t work well when statically linked. musl works well. But glibc has strong backward compatibility using symbol versioning. It&#x27;s not usually worth the trouble to build and link aginst musl if your distro uses glibc. What you should be worried about are all the other third-party libraries, which aren&#x27;t often written to be statically linked--because of namespace pollution, because of slightly different semantics between dynamic and static code, especially at application startup.<p>Fortunately, Linux supports packaging apps much like macOS bundles, where all shared objects are kept under a relocatable subtree. When building a binary that will be installed in bin&#x2F;, for example, just use the following GCC flags:<p><pre><code>  -Wl,-rpath,&#x27;$ORIGIN&#x2F;..&#x2F;lib&#x27; -Wl,--enable-new-dtags\n</code></pre>\nThe first flag tells the linker to find libraries in the lib&#x2F; directory adjacent to the binary file itself. The second flag tells the linker to try LD_LIBRARY_PATH first rather than the embedded rpath. Debugging and regression testing can be very difficult without the ability to use LD_LIBRARY_PATH, and unfortunately LD_LIBRARY_PATH has lower precedence than embedded rpaths, thus the need for --enable-new-dtags to change the default behavior.<p>Note that $ORIGIN is a special string that is expanded by the runtime linker, not by the shell at compile time. It&#x27;s an unfortunate choice of syntax. Getting $ORIGIN to pass through to the compiler without being evaluated by a shell can be tricky when dealing with recursive make and shell invocations, such as from an RPM spec file.<p>Another example: when building a Lua module I&#x27;ll use<p><pre><code>  -Wl,-rpath,&#x27;$ORIGIN&#x2F;..&#x2F;..&#x27; -Wl,--enable-new-dtags\n</code></pre>\nbecause Lua modules are usually installed under $(prefix)&#x2F;lib&#x2F;lua&#x2F;5.?&#x2F;, two directories below lib&#x2F;.","time":1493340875,"type":"comment"},{"by":"olalonde","id":14216375,"kids":[{"by":"TheSoftwareGuy","id":14216489,"kids":[{"by":"callahad","id":14216530,"kids":[{"deleted":true,"id":14218025,"parent":14216530,"time":1493371650,"type":"comment"}],"parent":14216489,"text":"The median salary for a software developer in the United States is six figures: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bls.gov&#x2F;ooh&#x2F;Computer-and-Information-Technology&#x2F;Software-developers.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bls.gov&#x2F;ooh&#x2F;Computer-and-Information-Technology&#x2F;...</a>","time":1493347298,"type":"comment"},{"by":"adrianN","id":14218045,"parent":14216489,"text":"Salary is not the only cost.","time":1493372062,"type":"comment"},{"by":"_pmf_","id":14217964,"parent":14216489,"text":"In the Land of Unlimited VC.","time":1493370687,"type":"comment"}],"parent":14216375,"text":"Do Linux kernel devs really make 6 figures on average??","time":1493346497,"type":"comment"}],"parent":14215616,"text":"&gt; What will it take to build this? 6 months x 3 smart devs who understand the linux kernel.

We are all communicating through IP protocol, which is inherently point to point, why building abstractions to the problem, when network already matches perfectly the requirements. I think we are so used to using a tool for everything that it feels weird to not have to use one. I was able to have a working POC in 10 lines of Python code (of course a final solution would be more).

The solution was to throw money at a problem, so why not have 2 or 3 environments with initial setup so while something happens to one you can switch to another while reloading the data.

Right now, the idea seems to be that if you stick your code and practically a complete user land in a container, you don&#x27;t have to do those things, as if old style deployments were the reason for those practises to be in place. Obviously, it is the other way around, and by trying to bypass them, you will run into the exact problems they are meant to prevent. (i.e. not knowing what is available&#x2F;what is released, not knowing the configuration within the infrastructure in a global scale, not knowing the side-effects of two opposing configurations because you have no management for that, not knowing what versions are used because it is spread out over different&#x2F;many unmanaged files inside containers somewhere, not knowing what is secure&#x2F;patched, not knowing what else is influencing your environment, no control over parameters that should be globally overridden...)<p>We take a different approach: you get do write your software, and may only configure requirements within its context. Those have to be defined in a SaltStack Formula with sane defaults, that has to run in a local environment, but also DTAP-style chains of environments with no changes to the app. You don&#x27;t get a say in what it will run on, but your required facilities will be available. If it doesn&#x27;t pass automated testing (i.e. sticking it in a VM, running a highstate and expecting a working app) it doesn&#x27;t get passed to DevOps and you&#x27;re stuck until you fixed your stuff. With regards to scaling, we make sure that a few calls are always available to the app and&#x2F;or it&#x27;s formula, so that we can register where it is and connect it to the correct balancing pools (i.e. incoming requests, but also FS, DB, queue pools). When it&#x27;s up, it registers, and as long as the automatic health checks pass it gets requests sent to it. If the load is too high, we scale up, if it&#x27;s been idle too long it scales down. But the app&#x2F;software&#x2F;code isn&#x27;t aware of that nor does it need to be, and using the reactor system, we don&#x27;t need &#x27;extra&#x27; management software to make that happen.

I don&#x27;t even think they meant it as much as it was a divide-and-conquer negotiation tactic (which unfortunately worked since my co-founder started to panic after that point and turn against me in the following discussions). We eventually sold (at a low price, given the circumstances) but it kind of set the tone for what would follow. Great way to completely sink an acquisition right from the beginning btw.<p>- Soon after I started I gave a little demo of what I&#x27;d been working on before the acquisition as a side&#x2F;thesis project. A team related to the one I was working in really liked it and wanted to have it and start a project with it. I was quite honored -- until I found out that the expectation was that I provide everything (code and other resources) for free, since they&#x27;d already acquired &quot;my talent&quot;, and that would extend even to unrelated stuff that I did before the acquisition (that was literally their argument). It took me two years of explaining and negotiation until they finally paid a modest price for it.<p>- That not being enough I soon found out that extracting IP from fresh graduates &#x2F; PhDs is actually quite common at Google. I know many examples where graduates &#x2F; PhDs were asked to put in code and documentation of their prior&#x2F;thesis work free of charge. Frankly I think that a lot of fresh graduates don&#x27;t even realize at that point that they are being screwed out of something that is rightfully theirs (or the universitiy&#x27;s -- depending on how their contracts were set up).<p>- The worst came out of people when the perf cycle came up. I&#x27;ve seen it over and over that engineers claimed they &quot;put feature X into Y&quot; when in reality feature X was implemented by another engineer and all they did was contribute some wiring code. Worst of all those kind of tricks not only didn&#x27;t get caught, but the engineers in question often got rewarded for it.<p>- And of course the time Google started copying books and put them online for free without asking authors for permission or when they started leeching content off of websites and putting it next to their own ads (see [1]) that&#x27;s not quite the display of the finest of manners either.<p>The kicker is that while all these things happened day in day out like it was no big deal most people in the company seemed to be convinced that Google operated on higher ethical standards than other companies.

At the energy&#x2F;temperature levels and magnetic field strength this machine is operating, plasma is showing all kinds of undesirable behavior, such as turbulence, radial forces... a little bit like the storms on Jupiter. This imposes many challenges, because as soon as the plasma escapes the magnetic field and touches the vessel, it rapidly cools - ending any potential fusion.<p>Wendelstein&#x27;s goal is to find out the viability of the stellarator concept, to see if it could be on par with the Tokamak concept, which so far have shown a better ratio of energy invested and energy won back, but come with their own bag of problems.<p>What the folks at Wendelstein are doing is a step by step verification of some of the hypothesis. There is this excellent 3h podcast with the scientific leader of Wendelstein [0], unfortunately it is in German. It is fascinating to hear their story on how they build this ultra complex piece of kit. The current change is the shielding of the vessel, which now permits higher energy levels and longer runs. Their long term goal is to operate at 100m K for 30 min.<p>Regarding the &quot;when we should stop trying&quot; and &quot;it is 30 years out&quot; adage: There has been great progress made in improving the ratio of energy invested and energy won back, the G-factor. Right now no fusion reactor is crossing the G &gt; 1 limit. But Iter would be design to yield about G = 5. Newer designs using high temperature superconductors could even yield G &gt; 10 with a smaller footprint.

Some folks are working on remotely operated unmanned submersibles to factor out the labor. Also missing is a grid of underwater cameras feeding a stream to a back-end object recognition cluster to map out real-time lionfish locations to maximize kill utilization ratios (too much time is spent looking for them instead of killing them).<p>Bootstrap enough of the industry, then build enough of the submersibles to permanently station around the most sensitive coral reefs and eventually entire islands and coastlines to &quot;fence them off&quot; from future infestations, and push them further out into the ocean where large predators can feast upon them as they have less cover to hide within, if the native oceanic predators can even eat them. There is some suspicion that in the invasive areas lionfish have no natural predators other than humans; sharks, groupers and eels can be trained to expect dead lionfish handouts from divers, but no one has yet documented them start to hunt the lionfish on their own in significant numbers. I would settle for pushing them out into the relative desert of the benthic ocean, and hope they starve out there.<p>Fortunately, someone has already worked out a filleting robot for haddock, and modifying its pattern recognition for lionfish requires enough a training corpus to make it sufficiently reliable, so once killed they can be quickly prepared and frozen. The most recent research indicates lionfish aren&#x27;t susceptible to Ciguatera. Unfortunately, lionfish toxins can also sometimes be found in their flesh, so they must be cooked (heat breaks down the toxins), and they can&#x27;t be introduced into the lucrative sushi and sashimi markets (though I&#x27;m sure enterprising sushi chefs will find delicious ways to prepare the cooked lionfish flesh).<p>Accuracy rates on automated classification of lionfish in live streaming video is so far not revealed in any write ups I&#x27;ve read, and especially false positives (killing fish that the classifier thinks is lionfish but actually are not). That&#x27;s a significant problem, and also the obstacle that I can&#x27;t work out to gamifying the killing of lionfish.<p>The threat of the more capital-intensive automation of industrial-scale lionfish hunting&#x2F;eradication also presents a challenge to locals who want to break into the market. Not much incentive for the locals to invest into opening the market when they know they could be out of a job within just a few years of establishing a lucrative market to well-capitalized (and often foreign) competitors who can tap more credit than the locals.<p>Currently, economically beneficial lionfish eradication for the locals is primarily focused upon leading hunts for diving tourists to favored dive spots, and not for systemic, industrial-scale, broad eradication across the entire coastline.

By over-practicing &#x27;algorithmic thinking&#x27; we develop a tendency to consider all thought to be of the problem solving kind, missing out on the more important aspects of &#x27;the life of the mind&#x27; (&quot;thinking, willing, and judging&quot;).<p>I just can&#x27;t really see that over exposure to problem solving would reduce, thinking, willing, or judging... The only justification given here is through an analogy the author gives, asking whether using Google can be considered &#x27;outsourcing&#x27; human memory. He says:<p>&gt; &quot;A moments reflection, of course, will reveal that human remembering involves considerably more than the mere retrieval of discreet bits of data.&quot;<p>So by only using algorithmic thinking, we are collapsing the potentially much richer range of thought to something analogous to &quot;the mere retrieval of discreet bits of data&quot; for memory—more specifically, it&#x27;s collapsed to mere problem solving.

I clip a lot of articles and code snippets to a datastore (Evernote in my case) where I can peruse my notes later. I install said tech and build little micro apps and generally futz around and have a good time. The key here is to be interested in the tech you are trying to learn. Maybe you are bored with C&#x2F;C++? Whats the harm in looking at something totally different like Ruby or NodeJS? They might give you ideas or a different way of looking at things. Whatever it is, try to have fun.

I think a lot of it starts with motivation. If you are just studying something for fun then the boring stuff does get really tedious.

Cards or random numbers are not particularly interesting, so these folks invent mind games. They may take each card to represent a particular object and then make up some crazy story involving these objects. Suddenly to them what was mindbogglingly dull becomes tantamount to some epic screen play.<p>You can employ similar tricks to studying any subject. When studying for my degree there were a few things that really helped. Note taking, notes had to be as vivid as possible. I would always have multiple coloured pens and highlights as possible. Pictures, various sized and coloured text and lots of arrows. My notes became art. Mnemonics and stories were important for the long lists of things.<p>Also managing energy levels is pretty important. Regular sleep cycles, exercise help maintain focus. Environment makes a big difference. A library is much better than the common room.. Also, slightly controversially, I find the often given advice to take regular breaks when studying was highly damaging. If I allow regular breaks, then my focus shifts to watching for when my next break is. Also in the breaks I would get time to think about how dull this stuff was. So I would find maintaining pure focus for about 4 hours at a stretch much easier. It helps to have a variety of studying techniques to move around in.
