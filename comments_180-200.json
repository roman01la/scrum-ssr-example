Companies only need to pay for time that is &quot;integral and indispensable&quot; to the labor in question.  In short if you aren&#x27;t actually earning money for the company, they don&#x27;t necessarily need to pay you.<p>It originated with mine workers who would have to take a long mine-elevator ride (30m+) to and from the vein, and companies didn&#x27;t want to pay for that time.  They successfully argued that the time spent riding the elevator was essentially part of your commute, just like driving to work, and they shouldn&#x27;t have to pay for it.<p>Lately it&#x27;s also been applied to things like Amazon warehouse workers, who need to stand in line for up to 30 minutes to go through a metal detector and be frisked on their way out of the warehouse.  That time is legally allowed to be unpaid.<p>In short - even if the work is in some sense &quot;necessary&quot; as a condition of your employment (you would be fired if you didn&#x27;t wait through Amazon&#x27;s frisk line), if it&#x27;s not actually <i>a primary part of the job</i> (the thing they are paying you to do) then they don&#x27;t have to pay you for it.<p>The FAA may mandate downtime, but that&#x27;s not part of <i>worker</i> safety per-se.  Consider if the pilot were taking that downtime on the ground - you obviously wouldn&#x27;t be paying them to do that.  Nor would you pay a long-haul trucker taking their downtime.<p>The company could argue that the &quot;portal&quot; in this sense is the cockpit door (rather than the door of the plane), and that being trapped in the plane during your off-duty time is just an unpleasant aspect of the job (like a miner being trapped in a mine elevator during some of their off-hours).  You&#x27;re perfectly free to watch a DVD or whatever [0] so you&#x27;re not really on-duty.<p>This is a pretty shitty thing in labor law overall, but as a descriptive statement - that&#x27;s how things are right now.  If the wheels aren&#x27;t turning, you ain&#x27;t earning.<p>Or at least if you&#x27;re earning it&#x27;s through the grace of your employer, not because they&#x27;re legally obligated to.<p>[0] Interestingly enough, the FAA doesn&#x27;t actually mandate <i>sleep</i> during off-hours.  Which is a big problem since many pilots are paid so poorly nowadays - they end up flipping burgers to make ends meet, instead of getting the sleep they need.

Both job wise (nicer to fly than to pack) and with regards to the pay.<p>Aviation is one of the most regulated sectors in both the US and worldwide. The reason why DHL uses subcontractors is not because they want to save money, they aren&#x27;t allowed to fly in the US. Which is somehow interesting because both Fedex and UPS are allowed to conduct inter-EU flights.<p>Also, flying Cargo is a hard job. Passengers don&#x27;t complain too much if the flight is delayed due to bad weather, the logistics companies can lose millions due to that. Pressure for cargo pilots to be on time has always been high and shifts have been long. His view is skewed because Fedex and UPS fly mostly domestically with short legs (3-4h). If you compare Southern to other global freight companies (e.g. Cargolux), conditions aren&#x27;t worse. It&#x27;s normal to be away from home for a week and only have stopovers somewhere in the desert or the middle of Siberia.<p>I somehow doubt the 23h flight story (the wording is very vague &quot;asked to sit on a flight&quot;) since regulation for pilots is very strict.<p>If Southern forces a pilot to fly a 23h shift with no third pilot on board then I&#x27;m sure the FAA would be very interested in that story and it would have consequences.<p>My guess is that there was a third pilot on board. It then still sucks having to be in an aircraft for 23h, but he didn&#x27;t have to work for 23h straight (which would&#x27;ve been very dangerous).<p>As hard as it might be for someone who dreamed of the amazing pilot job and is now flying weird shifts to unattractive cities: This is not an issue of outsourcing to get things cheaper or of paying people minimum wage for hard physical work without the chance of being represented by a union.

Suppose I am reading a 200 page mathematics book. I&#x27;m on page 150, and to understand something I want to review some point that was covered much earlier. I can close my eyes and visualize when I read that earlier point, and I get an image of the page it was on, where it was on that page, and how far it was into the book. I can pretty quickly jump back and find it.<p>This is not some &quot;photographic memory&quot; type thing. I don&#x27;t &quot;see&quot; the page word for word, and cannot read the page number to know where to go. But I will get that the page I&#x27;m looking for had a diagram on the bottom and was a left side page, and that what I wanted was near the middle...that kind of thing.<p>It is enough that when combined with the way the pages are laid out in a physical sequence to give a sense of &quot;place&quot; to each page and the information on it. It seems kind of like a weak form of a memory palace.<p>With an ebook I do not get that sense of place as I read, and so if I need to find something much earlier in the book I have to rely on the search function or the table of contents, and often have to do a lot of paging around (which is slow on eInk readers). It usually takes a lot longer than it would have taken in the paper book.<p>The second problem, specific to Amazon&#x27;s ereaders, is very inconsistent handling of images. For example I have some chess books that make extensive use of images for chess diagrams.<p>On my eInk Kindles, the chess diagrams are about the size of a postage stamp.<p>On the Kindle application for OS X, they are about the size that they would be in the paper book (in other words, they are the right size).<p>On the Kindle application for Windows, they are postage stamp sized.<p>On the Kindle Cloud Reader, the are the right size.<p>On the Kindle app for iOS they are the right size.<p>Same problem for math books. They often use images for equations. If those get the postage stamp treatment it makes that book very hard to deal with.<p>For things where images aren&#x27;t needed, and where I&#x27;m not going to have to do a lot of looking back, I&#x27;ve greatly enjoyed reading on Kindle.

I&#x27;ll never do any maths of interest or note to the professional maths community, but I hope they at least recognise the qualification :&#x2F;<p>Exams are a kid&#x27;s game, I learned; three hours in an exam hall with a brutal set of maths questions is physically exhausting as well as mentally. There were five of those. Fully five-sixths of the MMaths with the OU is (or was, when I did it) assessed purely on formal exams in big exam halls, which is the only way it can be, but it sure does pile on the pressure with the whole year&#x27;s worth of study riding on those three hours.<p>It taught me how to pick up a thick, savage maths text book and learn from it, which is a really useful ability. It also taught me to hate with a vengeance textbooks and explanations that don&#x27;t clearly define their terms, their operations and their ranges of applicability. I read Physics at university the first time round, which was short on computing lectures as you might expect, so my introduction to order notation was formal and mathematical; the last time someone asked me about it in an interview, they got diagrams, graphs, ranges of applicability, definitions, examples, a short diatribe about how using the symbol &#x27;=&#x27; was really unhelpful, the whole lot. Seemed to go well; when we got to the section on his &quot;things to ask about&quot; sheet marked &quot;communication skills&quot; he just put a tick in the box and said we could skip over it, so one unexpected benefit of maths as a hobby has been to force my own mathematical thinking into rigour, with a knock-on effect in technical communication.<p>How it works for me is probably not how it would work for everyone, and I learned it the hard way; grind. Hour after hour, evening after evening, weekend after weekend of just sitting at the table with the book, some pencils and pads of paper. Each time I&#x27;d be done for the day, I&#x27;d pick up and recycle the drifts of paper that had collected on the floor as I&#x27;d discarded each piece I didn&#x27;t need anymore. It gets in you, sometimes. I&#x27;d sit down at lunchtime with a sandwich, thinking I&#x27;d just look at the next question to get a feel for it, and get up again six hours later having thrashed it to death, picked it apart, textbooks I didn&#x27;t even remember fetching from the shelf open on the desk, and pages and pages around my feet containing my own handwriting that I also didn&#x27;t remember writing. Each time I found something I just couldn&#x27;t grasp, couldn&#x27;t understand, I&#x27;d just push on. Sometimes I&#x27;d never get it, sometimes I&#x27;d come back to it twenty pages later and it would seem simple (and sometimes I&#x27;d rage at how poorly the author had explained it, which was probably fifty percent the thrashing of my dying ego).<p>I have genuinely described as &quot;black magic&quot; taking a converging infinite series, and by adding zero to it, making it converge faster.

In ancient India, foreign conquerors solidified their conquest by imposing a religion on the populace. According to this religion, there were set classes or castes of people, and anyone born into the poor castes must have done something in a previous life to deserve such punishment. Similarly, the Calvinist attributes prosperity and poverty to the mysterious workings of God. (Notice that in both cases these beliefs serve to legitimize whatever the status quo power is. The wealthy and powerful, whether in ancient India or in post-Renaissance Switzerland or 18th century Scotland, are presented as justifiably wealthy. And the poor or &quot;untouchable&quot; are dismissed as unworthy of any better treatment. These are classic examples of ideology.)<p>Dickens captured exactly this peculiar combination of self-punishment, self-righteousness, and misanthropy in his character Scrooge.

We should not cling to happiness or greet its passing with a hollow laugh, for it is fleeting.

Most families can afford to pay for schooling their children, but very few children can afford to pay for schooling themselves. A private system depends, for almost all children, on parents caring enough about the welfare of their children to be willing to pay the cost of their education.<p>Most parents, in most societies, do care for the welfare of their children. In part this may be explained by altruism, itself explainable on evolutionary grounds, and in part by the desire of parents to have children capable of supporting them in their old age. These incentives are not perfect-there are parents who sacrifice the welfare of their children to their own welfare. But the alternative to allowing parents to make decisions for their children is not, as a general rule, having the decisions made by the children-five year olds lack not only income, but information and political power as well. The alternative to having a child&#x27;s parents make decisions for him is having other adults-school administrators, politicians, voters-make those decisions. Parents may not always be altruistic towards their children, but a child&#x27;s parents are, of all adults, the ones most likely to be. The argument against letting the parents make the decision is an even stronger argument against letting anyone else make it instead.<p>Here again, the empirical evidence is striking. Under circumstances of poverty difficult for most of us to imagine, British parents of the early 19th century managed to send almost all of their children to school-not for as long as our children go to school, but for long enough to acquire at least minimal skills. In this country a century later, immigrant parents routinely sacrificed themselves to promote the education of their children. We have yet to see any similar level of altruism on the part of those who control the government schools-say a teacher strike aimed at lowering teacher wages in order to leave more money to pay for books.</i><p>I&#x27;m not sure this guy actually lives in the real world.

I think people who won&#x27;t&#x2F;cant empathize have a more simplistic view of the world as well - if you are poor you are lazy, everyone starts relatively similarly and what happens to you is mostly (if not all) related to the effort you&#x27;ve put in because maybe that has been their personal experience. I&#x27;ve been lucky enough to relate to this because I haven&#x27;t had anything directly holding me back (that I am aware of), so my success or lack of success is more directly attributable to my choices and work ethic than people in worse situations than me but that doesn&#x27;t prevent me from seeing how circumstances dictate choices and opportunities.<p>I also think that there is as psychological aspect to this in that a lack of empathy also allows people who are not poor or homeless to feel as though they achieved it.

But, he&#x27;s a good scientist, so he did eventually report his findings [1].<p>So, if you want that genuine sense of community togetherness, you need to:<p>1. Develop a distinct identity, with a clear definition for who is and who is not in the tribe. People being as they are, you need to develop a feeling of specialness in the in-group, and a sense of otherness towards outsiders.\n2. Encourage group-signifying standards, practices, and rituals on members.\n3. Do not admit new members who cannot or will not homogenize into those tribal signifiers.\n4.

Unity (while learning from others) is strength. Diversity is conflict.<p>And everyone knows this, when it&#x27;s presented the right way. We all know that it was a great crime when the British and French deliberately drew Middle Eastern country borders to contain several tribes in one country. Iraq is in constant civil war because it was <i>designed</i> to be in constant civil war, by putting together Kurds and Shia and Sunni in one country. The British used diversity as a weapon on the Arabs, and it worked. It&#x27;s still working. The damage never ends. Meanwhile, Iran is at peace, because it is reasonably homogenous. So is Pakistan, because they persecuted the Hindu population from 15% in 1948 to 0% today.<p>Diversity is not strength.

I complained to the international office. They talked to the professor. The professor then talked to me, said I&#x27;d been gossiping bad things about him to people in the administration, and kicked me out of his lab.<p>No professor, no lab, no university, no student visa, no country. Everything fell apart.<p>A friend there told me to get a job with his brother in India, which I accepted. It was only paying 5000 rupees&#x2F;month (78 USD&#x2F;month), but accommodation was provided (food was not). I sent thousands of job applications to try to get out of there, and finally gave up and posted an emotional rant on Facebook. A previous colleague saw it, talked to my old boss in Taiwan, and somehow got me an invitation to work here. Even though my salary is much lower than it would be in a Western country, I&#x27;m terrified that if I leave, I won&#x27;t be able to come back. Articles about homelessness and poverty often show up on Hacker News, and keep convincing me that I should just stay comfortable. I&#x27;ll never be able to afford a house or learn to drive, and I probably can&#x27;t afford to get married. But at least I have food and shelter, and that&#x27;s the most I can hope for.","time":1493256710,"type":"comment"},{"by":"nabla9","id":14204158,"kids":[{"by":"drzaiusapelord","id":14204785,"kids":[{"by":"nabla9","id":14205084,"parent":14204785,"text":"Guaranteed income schemes (basic income, negative income tax) are   economically sound policies because the makes it possible for low productivity workers to contribute without incentive traps.

Single-issue voters are real; I&#x27;ve met many.  They all seem to be on the right, however: they have two issues, abortion and guns.  There&#x27;s no shortage of people I&#x27;ve heard say &quot;I won&#x27;t vote for X because s&#x2F;he wants gun control&quot;, and all other issues be damned.  So it&#x27;s really easy for that party to just harp on those issues and get lots of votes from people who just refuse to think about anything else until they get their way on those.  I really do think that, for those voters, candidates could tell them &quot;I&#x27;m going to work to ban abortion and eliminate all gun restrictions, and I&#x27;m also going to increase your taxes 5-fold while eliminating all taxes for richer people, and I&#x27;m also going to help some companies pollute the land you&#x27;re living on and prevent you from taking legal action against them&quot;, and these candidates would still get elected by these people.<p>However, this doesn&#x27;t make my initial statement wrong: I said these people are voting against their best interests economically, and it&#x27;s true.  And it&#x27;s my contention that these people are actually stupid because they do this, by prioritizing a couple of hot-button issues over things that really would affect them personally in a much more profound way than whether other people have abortions (RvW has been around for over 40 years now) or whether they can own machine guns (gun laws in this country are already very lax and no national candidate has proposed doing much to change that for some time now).<p>I have no idea how you get people to think critically when they&#x27;ve never done it before.  The only way I&#x27;ve seen that actually works here is for someone to get a decent education.  That just isn&#x27;t going to happen for some middle-aged conservative living in West Virginia mining coal.  Worse, it&#x27;s not just uneducated blue-collar workers voting this way, there&#x27;s plenty of seemingly-intelligent people who have bought into very far right-wing politics, for very different reasons than what I mentioned above.

I&#x27;ll vote for that one.&quot; I think you&#x27;d agree that the vast majority of people are <i>not</i> doing this. They&#x27;re voting for candidates who appeal to them and what they feel is in their best interest.<p>There&#x27;s at least one confounding factor that may make it more difficult for one to understand the voting behavior of another: candidates represent a prioritized set of values, and that set may not perfectly (actually, very likely doesn&#x27;t) match the prioritized set of values of the voter. (There are single-issue voters out there, and it would interesting to know what percentage of people are and for which issues.) For example, while a voter may appear to be voting against their economic best interest, perhaps social issues are more important to them, and they&#x27;ll choose a candidate that appeals to those social issues.<p>And, of course, there&#x27;s the biases that are a part of human psychology.

People can be influenced to make decisions that are against their best interests (for whatever value of best interest you&#x27;d like to propose). From that point of view, we can try to get people to vote better through education and influence. And again, what that means is up for debate: you could say voting better means for their best interests economically, but even that leaves open the question of what that means: short-term outcomes? Long-term outcomes? Economically better for their children? Grandchildren? Their community? The country? The world?<p>I grant you, it&#x27;s not an easy problem to fix.

And we have this crazy, weird attitude towards power where we sometimes just give it away, dispersing it to the four winds, instead of milking it as a cash cow until we die.  That makes traditional politics very wary of the tech community.  They literally cannot understand how our minds work, and they have very little idea what we might actually <i>want</i>.  They also have some inkling that a large fraction of worldwide prosperity is now utterly dependent in some way on us, and they desperately need to keep us under control before we (probably accidentally) transform the planet into some form of sci-fi techo-topia that is simultaneously inspiring and horrifying.","time":1493304519,"type":"comment"},{"by":"sdflkd","id":14206204,"kids":[{"by":"RightMillennial","id":14206289,"parent":14206204,"text":"I think those are the libertarians.","time":1493235748,"type":"comment"}],"parent":14205905,"text":"HN has a lot of right-wing people when it comes to capitalism &amp; the meritocracy of America.","time":1493235116,"type":"comment"},{"by":"Arizhel","id":14206504,"kids":[{"by":"rconti","id":14208185,"parent":14206504,"text":"Maybe the downvotes are because of the fairly aggressive political stance?

I think his &#x27;whole selling point&#x27; message is: when this happens, you need to reassess the value you give this part, as, until you get to resolve what it is causing it to get you stuck, its value to <i>you</i> is pretty much the value of the whole machine. Like how a crashing bug means that specific software is useless, in the specific use case that triggers the bug, until that is fixed. If it&#x27;s some weird edge case, the software may be perfectly usable for most people, but if you are one of the few affected by it, the most likely few lines of code causing the defect render the whole thing useless, they&#x27;re the selling point of the software to you individually.<p>Now, obviously, speaking of the actual physical motorcycle, it&#x27;s not that he can&#x27;t sell it without resolving the problem that particular screw is causing him. There are probably skilled mechanics with the right training and tools for which the screw would cause little to no problem.

When you learn about how to meditate, you learn how to stop your mind from thinking about the future and concentrate completely on the here and now.

I met Prof MUkherjee, who was retired by the time I went looking for him. I tracked him down and asked him if he remembered Mr Robert Pirsig (I took a picture that I had printed from the internet). He told me about a curious &quot;American fellow&quot; who used to &quot;audit&quot; the classes in the philosophy department, hang around the library and the canteen - and would seek him out to have discussions with him. He said that he was very quiet and nice guy.<p>Interestingly, Prof Mukherjee had no idea that Mr Pirsig has written this cult book or that he was a famous author&#x2F;philosopher. To him, he was just an odd student (because of his age).<p>I wrote about this in our campus newspaper - but no one cared. I thought that I was the only fan of Mr Pirsig in this small town in India. Once I found the <i>internet</i> I discovered that I wasn&#x27;t alone. It was a great feeling.<p>Anyway, i was very proud that he went to the same university that i went to.

I was very heavily influenced by the book and still am in many respects, but ended up completely rejecting his conclusory argument. (Readers who don&#x27;t want to spoil their experience of the book should move on now.)<p>Where I think he goes wrong is his conflation of quality with desire, as summed up in the phrase &#x27;quality is what you like.&#x27; Something about this gnawed at me because from an early age I noticed that that aesthetic quality and taste were poorly correlated for me; there are things I like that are objectively crap and conversely there are art objects of high quality that I don&#x27;t like or were even hostile towards at first.<p>My go-to example for this sort of thing is Francis Bacon, the English painter. I hate almost everything of his I&#x27;ve seen. It repulses me on a visceral level, such that I find his work almost physically painful to look at. But his painting is of very very high quality. Bacon was a true master of composition and other measurable factors of aesthetic quality. It is his mastery of those painterly techniques that make the unpleasantness of his work so impactful.<p>I have my doubts about Pirsig&#x27;s relationship to art. You&#x27;ll recall the tale of when he was on the faculty at Boise, and his friend (an art professor) came around one evening for a social purpose, to find Pirsig wrapping a table in string for the eminently practical purpose of holding it under tension so that the glue he had just applied could set properly. The art professor is surprised and Pirsig decides to have a little fun with him by saying it&#x27;s an art project, which naturally intrigues the art professor who begins evaluating it without any awareness of its more quotidian nature.<p>this bothered me; Pirsig aimed to point out the arbitrary and unfalsifiable nature of art so as to disqualify it as a vehicle for truth, and indeed he is not alone; many people have such a reaction to modern art because abstraction or the fetishization of expression (in the MArxist rather than the Freudian sense) devalues the representational aspect, even though the latter is the easiest for people to evaluate by simply observing the degree of convergence between the quality of representation in the art work and their experience of the physical world.<p>But Pirsig was writing from the perspective of a technician or engineer, in which <i>qualia</i> can be ranked objectively in terms of their contribution to some truth-seeking function, <i>qua</i> his masterful exegesis of the scientific method for solving ordinary problems like undesirable behavior of a motorcycle. Valuable though this is, it falls apart in three ways when Pirsig sails too close to the rocks of aesthetics: function, scope and intentionality.<p>First, Pirsig has a poor understanding of artistic function; he doesn&#x27;t seem to understand art in contexts other than pictorial. Art consists of implicit assertions about proportion and harmony which are more or less successful depending on the degree to which those assumptions reflect our understanding of nature.<p>To an artist, the pictorial content of a work is often the least interesting aspect - it&#x27;s not uncommon to evaluate a picture upside down or through squinted eyes so as to be able to see less of the distracting subject matter. We are often much more interested in the claims that are being made about proportionality or symmetry - spatial, chromatic, luminous, or other types. These things are what abstract art is <i>about</i>, and the clarity with which such assertions are made are what cause some people to rave about the quality of what may seem like random splotches or clumsy daubings to the unseeing eye. Education helps but I&#x27;m not sure you can teach taste; I knew <i>what</i> I admired from a very young age, decades before accumulating enough knowledge to be able to objectively explain <i>why</i> I liked it.<p>By scope I mean the degree of universality in the cumulative assertions of the work, the specificity or generality of the truth it is asserting. This is very hard to put into words  -\n and arguably the better the art, the less the degree to which the underlying concept <i>can</i> be expressed by other means, or it wouldn&#x27;t have been necessary to go to all the bother of rendering it in paint in the first place. It is perhaps the degree to which the different elements of the work support and reinforce its central thesis, which extends to the semantic and symbolic levels.<p>The last question, of intent, is an especially thorny one. For Pirsig, the professor&#x27;s enthusiasm over the string table was foolish because Pirsig&#x27;s intention was aesthetic rather than practical, and he assumes that aesthetic value stems from authority, that is the economic decision to create something at a cost in time and effort. But is it? This is a very tricky question and one that modernism has failed to answer.<p>The most famous art example of this is <i>Foundtain</i>, which consists of a urinal which has been laid upon its back and declared an art object and duly signed &#x27;R. Mutt&#x27;, a pseudonym of the Dadaist artist Marcel duchamp. Or was it? There&#x27;s evidence to suggest that both the submission and the signature were actually the product of his friend, the enigmatic Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven, and that Duchamp simply took the credit when the rest of the art world came around to his view that found objects could be art.<p>Anyway, let us imagine a situation in which Pirsig, overwhelmed by amusement, suffered a heart attack and died immediately after conning the art professor into evaluating his String Table as art rather than furniture repair. Let us assume that the professor saw some or other formal quality about the work that made it attractive to his experienced eye, regardless of whether this aesthetic quality was the product of accident or some subconscious aesthetic impulse on Pirsig&#x27;s part. Let us further imagine that Pirsig&#x27;s tragic death by laughter following on the completion of his first and only artwork was sufficiently interesting to hook the attention of the art world, which then fell in love with the piece on its own merits, and that it now occupies pride of place in a great museum, viewed and loved by millions who know nothing of its provenance. Are they all idiots?<p>I argue that art inheres in the work, regardless of the intention with which it was created. It is sufficient that it was wrought (natural objects are merely pretty), but Pirsig&#x27;s artistic intention or lack thereof is irrelevant to the question of whether it embodies aesthetic truth. To see why, let us consider a parallel paradox of monkeys with typewriters. We are all familiar with the idea that infinite typewriting monkeys might reproduce the work of Shakespeare, but also with the extreme remoteness of such a possibility. But once you&#x27;ve persuaded monkeys to take up typing, it&#x27;s not so hard to imagine that one might crank out &#x27;E=mc^2&#x27; in a reasonable timeframe, say by Wednesday of next week. Would that be a valid theorem?<p>Obviously the monkeys know nothing of physics and can only be persuaded to bang on the typewriter because I keep supplying them with bananas. Indeed we could dispense with the monkeys altogether and instead draw Scrabble tiles out of a bag or something to underscore the random nature of the process. But now here comes that bum Einstein, with his inchoate intuitions about the nature of space and time, perplexedly pondering the relationships between energy, matter, and the speed of light. The monkeys flee the scene in terror, crying &#x27;Beware! Beware! His flashing eyes, his floating hair!&#x27; and the commotion distracts Einstein enough to look at their output, which equation results in his illumination and subsequent adulation.<p>Chance favors the prepared mind, of course, and it is only because Einstein was obsessed with such topics that the random keystrokes on the page were imbued with meaning for him, and him alone - but thanks to your familiarity with relativity, that same page would be imbued with meaning for you too if you were to see, regardless of whether you knew about the monkeys. It <i>happens</i> to be true (assuming you believe in relativity), notwithstanding the fact that it was produced by a system that produced a mixture of both false and true theorems through a random process. Following Godel, we can not prove the truth of the assertion within the system that produced it due to its lack of a truth-selection rule, but this is no barrier to be it being <i>recognized</i> as true from within the confines of a more rigorous system where its truth could be rigorously asserted.<p>I argue that it is this recognition of truth, however inchoate or hard to articulate, on the part of viewer that invests a constructed object with art value independently of the intention with which it was created. I do not meant hat truth shines out from art like a lamp, only that it is independent of the intent with which it was created. In this sense a piece of &#x27;accidental art&#x27; would be a discovery rather than invention, but science and to some extent mathematics is full of such accidental discoveries, and we don&#x27;t hold those discoveries to be any less valuable even if we sometimes suspect the discoverers of having been lucky rather than clever.<p>I do think that ultimately Pirsig&#x27;s argument is indeed religious, in that he equates successful function with mastery of Plato&#x27;s ideal forms and the subsequent realization of the imaginary hypothesis - a conclusion that might reasonably be extended to the material world as a whole. In his follow-up book, <i>Lila</i>, he attempted to derive a moral philosophy from first principles and I feel his narrow determinism limited the scope of his exploration, though perhaps I&#x27;m associating his philosophical argument too closely with the bounds of the rover on which his houseboat was situated for that story, not unlike the freewheeling motorcycle journey that was nevertheless constricted by the necessity of staying on the road.","time":1493104802,"type":"comment"}],"parent":14190367,"text":"I&#x27;ve read both books and I&#x27;d be very interested in reading how they are related.<p>I do agree they are related, but though the use of the word &quot;quality&quot; in both contexts probably confuses issues rather than illuminates them.<p>I agree with Paul Graham when he says that most philosophical discussions reduce to disagreements over the meaning of words: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.paulgraham.com&#x2F;philosophy.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.paulgraham.com&#x2F;philosophy.html</a><p>It&#x27;s also true that both Pirsig and Alexander are reluctant to define their respective &quot;quality&quot;.

Many of those connections would be missed by monolingual native speakers, even though they have much more overall ability in the languages!<p>It&#x27;s also interesting to see how different languages give you different options.

Portuguese lacks these, but has infinitives that can inflect for person and number, so you can say &quot;for us to write&quot; in a single word. English has neither! This is just scratching the surface of grammatical variation within closely related languages.<p>I think the controversy alluded to in this thread is that there is an old, fascinating theory that people think qualitatively differently when using different languages, or else that some languages are more effective at or conducive to thinking certain thoughts.

My wife is easily the most intelligent human being I&#x27;ve ever met and I&#x27;ve had to work a lot during our first year in the relationship until she started openly sharing what she thinks about this or that.

Some people are not amazing at striking a conversation but if you manage to engage them, you might discover a treasure.<p>- Show genuine interest in what the person is doing at the event you both find yourself meeting at. I&#x27;d be very honest with you and one good example of that honesty would be: &quot;I believe I spent so much time perfecting my engineering skills, and now I simply want to listen what people need from technology; how do they want their lives improved by it&quot;. That would probably open a plethora of possible follow-up topics.<p>- Many of the people of my type find networking and investing in a portfolio &#x2F; GitHub profile &#x2F; LinkedIn profile &#x2F; general reputation a low priority activity. That&#x27;s of course horribly misguided since millions of years of social instincts can&#x27;t be overriden but there you go; I am 37 and only now I started actually understanding the value of these, and started slowly working on them. That&#x27;s the thing: I&#x27;ve been busy with far too many other things to even consider networking for so long. Food for thought IMO; strike a conversation accentuating what the person is thinking and doing now, not what he&#x2F;she was doing all their life up to this point. The past can wait for a later convo.<p>- Finally, as the article suggested, do offer some value to the conversation even if you find yourself getting a lot of important information for free. I am a bad salesman of information and I&#x27;d tell you a lot of things we the programmers do without telling our bosses (one random example; another one would be some trade secrets) but if 15 minutes later I realize that you haven&#x27;t offered a single interesting piece of info or a compelling question, I&#x27;ll politely excuse myself and will go look for another person to chat with.<p>Hope that helps a bit.","time":1493159719,"type":"comment"},{"by":"emergencevector","id":14197856,"parent":14197129,"text":"You apply the principles to the principals.","time":1493153360,"type":"comment"},{"deleted":true,"id":14197576,"parent":14197129,"time":1493151467,"type":"comment"},{"deleted":true,"id":14197523,"parent":14197129,"time":1493151017,"type":"comment"}],"parent":14196900,"text":"That&#x27;s the point here.<p>There are a lot of people out there applying these principals who don&#x27;t really do shit, but by god they are &quot;well connected.&quot; You see them at all these entrepreneur events and all they do is waste everyone&#x27;s time with their bullshit.

A lot of the stuff you run across is intuitively true and you can immediately recognize it throughout your life. Doing the research gives you a vocabulary to describe it and heightens your awareness significantly, enabling you to better utilize the social skills that we all have hiding under the covers somewhere. :)<p>It is important to carefully select your material, though, because there is a lot of nonsense pop psychology out there. I would avoid the more general, mass-appeal stuff and stick to the classics starting out.<p>&gt;It&#x27;s interesting that on one side you have Carnegie&#x27;s &quot;make them feel important to make them interested in you&quot; and on the other side you have the pick-up artists&#x27; (I&#x27;m not defending them) &quot;neg them to make them interested in you&quot;.

That creates the impression that if no one else is interested in your time, it may not be valuable.<p>Since important people don&#x27;t hang out with unimportant people, this causes the potential partner to worry about their association with you, and how it may affect their importance, both in the absolute&#x2F;real sense and in the perception of others.<p>I haven&#x27;t gone deep into the pick up artist scene, so I&#x27;m not really familiar with the intricacies of &quot;negging&quot;. I&#x27;m sure that a lot of parts of it are way overboard. But they are correct that in seduction, few things are quite so fatal as the whiff of desperation. It devalues everyone involved.<p>&gt;what it does is it shifts your focus from what you can do to look good yourself to what you can do to make the other person look good, which is often a lot easier anyway. It takes you out of your own head and makes you more attentive and focused on the other person, so that you can respond to and amplify the good thing they do.<p>Also yes, I think this is one of the keys too.

The question is how to identify which questions lead to good conversation and which questions risk shutting it down. Avoiding obvious yes&#x2F;no questions is one way, or at least use those questions sparingly, but try to go elsewhere.<p>I currently read the pen-and-paper RPG Microscope, and one rule in the game is that before a scene you select a question to direct the action. The scene concludes when the question has been answered. There&#x27;s no game master so all players collaborate to create characters and answer the scene question.<p>The game text says &quot;The best questions are extremely specific. Vague questions are bad and lead to confusing or muddled scenes. Open-ended questions can work, but you will get much better scenes out of very loaded or incriminating questions.&quot;<p>The game goes on to list examples:<p>&quot;If you have an idea you want to explore, don&#x27;t hesitate to stack the deck and make your question more specific. A simple formula is to just add more conditions or &#x27;even though&#x27; twists to establish clear issues.<p>&#x27;How does the Alliance beat the invaders?&#x27; is a good starting point, but that&#x27;s a very open-ended scene.<p>&#x27;How does the Alliance beat the invaders even though they&#x27;re outnumbered and outgunned?&#x27; is more specific. We have a better idea of the situation.<p>&#x27;Is the Alliance willing to sacrifice the colony on Sigma VII to beat the invaders even though the colonists will get slaughtered in the process?&#x27; is better still because it gives us a clear situation, an obvious dilemma.&quot;<p>Finally, on good questions:<p>&quot;It may not immediately be clear why a question is interesting. Don&#x27;t be alarmed. Once you ask the question, the other players get to jump in and run with it. They may have ideas you didn&#x27;t even consider. So long as your question gets everyone on the same page about the scene, you&#x27;re in good shape.&quot;<p>This relates to what hueving said. The game assumes that the other players want to turn your questions into something interesting, and that you collaborate to create something great. If the other players are hostile or indifferent, they can ignore your question and take the scene in a completely different direction so that it never ends, but the point is that some questions have a better chance of keeping things on track. The same with other people. If you&#x27;re talking to someone indifferent to hostile, they can obviously shoot down all conversation, but if they&#x27;re indifferent to positive, you may have a chance to interest them.<p>I looked up Kezia Noble on YouTube, having never heard of her.

While I am naturally skeptical of any kind of &#x27;people categorization&#x27; - I do think there are folks who find &quot;networking&quot; daunting. So, what should they do?<p>I think the first step is to acknowledge the importance of a good network of people that you can talk to - it is often a powerful source of diverse ideas (outside of your own bubble), mentorship, collaboration and even friendship. The reason I say this is because it is often easy to dismiss &quot;networking&quot; as something frivolous (it doesn&#x27;t help sometimes when certain people hijack this word to mean lots of low-quality connections) or not-for-me or &#x27;I am just happy doing my own thing&#x27; etc. I think a discussion about how networking helps us in various facets of life is important. I&#x27;d love to hear positive examples from others in this area.<p>The second step is to work towards a realization that most of the qualities that introverts likely possess - like &quot;listening well&quot; - are key to this &quot;networking-thing&quot;. So you already possess a lot of the raw ingredients that are needed to have a good network of people.<p>The third step is to really value diversity - of ideas&#x2F;opinions, knowledge and competence (e.g. &quot;engineering&quot; sometimes have reluctance in appreciating &quot;sales&quot;). Groups, companies, teams thrive when there is <i>real</i> diversity. This should make you want to talk to others who are doing different things in different domains (or same things as you, but differently)<p>And finally, realize that (and several folks points this out in the comments) it is not about &quot;tricks&quot; - i.e. don&#x27;t lose your authentic self. But try to distil the &quot;tricks&quot; into more basic human tenets - e.g. if you are a curious individual genuinely interesting in learning more about technology (say), then &quot;Convey genuine appreciation&quot; isn&#x27;t something you would need to fake.<p>The longer I work and observe other folks doing interesting things, the more I find that networking is a useful (even powerful) thing -- and I say this as an introvert and someone not proficient at networking (have a very small group of close friends). I often think &quot;wouldn&#x27;t it be cool to learn more about what this person is doing&quot; or even &quot;how did they do that!?&quot;, and lately (gradually) started acting on that impulse and wrote to some of those folks (that I wish to know and learn from). To my surprise, it was very rewarding. I met some very knowledgeable and interesting people -- even some that I learned from a lot. Just having a bunch of people that I can discuss different topics with - related to software, scaling, operations (or life in general!) has been rewarding.<p>Most of what I say here is obvious, but I just wanted to share this because I struggled (and continue to) with this whole &quot;networking-thing&quot;. :)","time":1493148288,"type":"comment"},{"by":"traviswingo","id":14200089,"parent":14195664,"text":"This reminds me of &quot;How to Win Friends and Influence People&quot; by Dale Carnegie.

The issue is we only have the present way to think about how the future will work. The future will likely eliminate a lot of mundane engineering jobs (e.g. CRUD apps) with tools that provide automation (learned or programmed) and more intuitive interfaces for the layman. Not all work can be automated, but those are the edge cases. The focus is to eliminate <i>most</i> work, by building smarter and more niche services.<p>For example, Squarespace, Wix, Shopify, et al have reduced the number of jobs for CMS and ecommerce developers. Zapier and IFTTT have reduced the number of integration jobs. The Grid was an experiment in creating whole websites automatically (most regard it as a failure, but the tech will likely catch up). There&#x27;s research into using ML to identify and correct bugs in code. These are the low hanging fruit that will erode away at the jobs easiest to automate, leaving behind more niche work.<p>It&#x27;s hard to imagine less work for engineers in the future because there&#x27;s so much work to go around right now. That&#x27;s likely the case presently because there&#x27;s so many industries where manual labor can be eliminated, creating lots of new labor for engineers. Whole industries may be disrupted until  corporations with automation emerge and take over.

Mysql is definitely a &quot;lesser&quot; database, that seems to be widely known and accepted. It seems to be also very frustrating for the PostGres team that that is not the sole factor, but it isn&#x27;t. For a shared database it&#x27;s not even that high up there. This slideshow is bemoaning that Uber seems to find the design decisions of PostGres a problem. Really, they&#x27;re fine decisions &quot;just get a department to deal with them&quot;, is the message. And yes, that is very much the PostGres attitude.<p>The great thing about MySQL is that it generally just keeps working with incredibly small amounts of maintenance whereas PostGRESQL just constantly needs attention. This has always been my personal complaint. From vacuuming (yes I used PostGRESQL before autovacuum, and you can still fuck up autovacuum) to upgrades, everything is just fiddly fiddly fiddly.<p>The end result is that mysql, you start it, you run it, you do your normal OS upgrades and everything just kinda hums along. For years and years. PostGRESQL is like all enterprise solutions : you start it and run it and a month or so and it suddenly refuses to accept connections, or suddenly it starts using too much disk (e.g. misconfiguring autovacuum), or ... It has a bazillion things you need to configure and make cooperate and there&#x27;s large procedures for everything you need do to. Every week some warning light goes all flashy and won&#x27;t stop flashing until it made you press a few buttons where it was perfectly predictable which buttons needed to be pressed. It forces you to consider 2000 configuration options, rather than picking sensible defaults, instead asking.<p>But yes, you get something back for that. A bigger, better, more correct and far more featureful database. In many ways it starts having the issues of other large databases (e.g. the 3-page-and-totally-inscrutable SQL stored procedure functions).<p>This is very much a case of &quot;pick your poison&quot;. But frankly, if you want your app to just run, like we all do, MySQL will serve you better. If your OCD can&#x27;t deal with small imperfections, datatypes that fit only 99%, having values that your text mode SELECT in the database can&#x27;t print ... if those bother you, stay away from MySQL. And of course the classic, if you have a &quot;real database workload&quot; (very heavy load with constant reads AND constant writes), yes you probably need PostGRESQL.<p>You could say Mysql is halfway between LevelDB and PostGres.<p>By the way, if you need a mobile database with zero maintenance, SQLite will serve you even better.

Traffic usually mean that just don&#x27;t get a large enough gap to get in without accelerating hard, which isn&#x27;t really safe.

You are assuming a world in which we have eliminated all penalties against people who have not done actual harm, but nothing else has changed from our current world. That is not at all what I have been assuming. I am trying to contrast what we have now--a system in which the law penalizes people who have done no actual harm, and which has evolved for a long time under that assumption--with what we would have if a system in which the law does not penalize people who have done no actual harm had evolved for a long time under <i>that</i> assumption. In such a world, many, many things would be different from today&#x27;s world.<p>As an illustration, I&#x27;ll redescribe your two scenarios:<p>A company wants to build a nuclear plant on Lake Michigan. However, when they try to acquire the land, they find the landowners asking what they are going to use the land for, and when they say a nuclear plant, they start getting asked all kinds of hard questions about the risks involved. They can&#x27;t give satisfactory answers, so the landowners refuse to sell. Similarly, when they try to recruit people to help work on the plant, they find the prospective employees asking the same hard questions, and refusing to work for them when they don&#x27;t get satisfactory answers.<p>A lab wants to manufacture biological weapons. However, they are unable to get funding to even start, because there are no dictators or similar insane rulers to sell to. Plus, once the lab&#x27;s employees find out what the owners are thinking, they all quit.<p>In short, in our current world, where we allow the law to penalize people preemptively, everyone expects the few people who make the laws to be responsible for stopping people from doing harmful things. So nobody feels individually responsible for doing it. In the world I&#x27;m describing, where everyone understands that the law won&#x27;t step in until actual harm is done, everyone feels individually responsible for stopping people from doing harmful things, which means stepping in preemptively based on their own individual judgment instead of expecting the law to do it.<p>Would such a world be free of harmful things? Of course not. But neither is our current world. The question is, would the world I&#x27;m describing have <i>fewer</i> harmful things happen? Would it have fewer than 10k drunk driving deaths a year?

First of all one can simply be &quot;lucky&quot; with careless driving or just straight defective brakes.<p>Second I seen how law enforcement changed driver behaviour in my country of origin. Even with extreme amount of corruption it&#x27;s still forced almost everyone to use seat belts, pass vehicle inspection regularly and avoid breaking the law if there is chance that will end up with loss of their driving license or huge bribe. I totally sure that without proper enforcement that would be never achieved otherwise.<p>Third is that I seen the difference between driving behaviour in the UK and Asia and while UK system cause a lot of false positives lethality numbers make a big deal. Even if enforcement is not the only measure to calm traffic it&#x27;s important one.

The low prosecution rate isn’t a secret and has inspired many to wonder whether plowing into a cyclist with a car is a low-risk way to commit homicide.<p>&gt;Nationwide, incidents like Cann’s often result in misdemeanor charges, tickets, or nothing. Leah Shahum from the San Francisco Bike Coalition told the New York Times last year that her organization does “not know of a single case of a cyclist fatality in which the driver was prosecuted, except for DUI or hit-and-run.” Kristin Smith, also of the SF Coalition, says that “Last year, four people were hit and killed in San Francisco and no charges were ever brought,” including for a collision captured on video that showed the driver was at fault.

Amazingly, given that this is one of the most crowded parts of town, no one was killed. Less amazingly, given the New York Police Department’s general approach toward car-pedestrian or car-bicycle crashes, the driver will apparently not face any criminal charges.<p>&gt;Despite remarkable recent gains in pedestrian safety – thanks in part to design changes aimed at slowing down drivers – cars still jump the curb nearly every day. Drivers who kill or maim pedestrians with their vehicles are still only rarely treated as criminals in New York, as long as they are not drunk and do not flee the scene. Even that is sometimes not enough to merit serious charges.<p>&gt;Twenty years ago, an out-of-control driver plowed through New York’s Washington Square Park, killing 5 people and injuring 27 others. That horrific incident caused a public outcry and galvanized advocates in what has become known as the livable streets movement.

The driver never faced any charges — not even a traffic citation.<p>&gt;The decision not to cite the driver who struck Wiggins isn’t unusual. The majority of drivers who killed pedestrians between 2010 and 2014 were not charged, according to Star Tribune analysis of metro area crash data. Those who were charged often faced misdemeanors — from speeding to careless driving — with minimal penalties, unless the driver knowingly fled or was intoxicated at the time of the crash.<p>&gt;Charles Roger Lord died after being struck by a van while checking out a Nice Ride bike on a north Minneapolis sidewalk in 2014.

He said he did not know he had hit someone before fleeing and blamed the crash on problems with the van’s steering.

Until last year, the road was in such bad repair that most traffic only averaged around 30. Then they repaved the road, and despite it still being 2 lane with parking on both sides, tons of merge traffic without any lights (from stopsigns) and being next to the town park with a ton of foot traffic, I&#x27;d estimate the average speed on that road is now 45-50mph. Precisely because its straight, freshly paved, and nobody wants to slow down the traffic when its smooth sailing with no lights.<p>To try to counteract this, those signs that tell you your speed were put up that blink when you are going over the limit. They were promptly ignored.<p>So really I&#x27;m just trying to reiterate that what the article says is absolutely true - people will drive what they feel comfortable going, not what the posted speed limit says. In practice, the risks are there, but nowadays everyone knows to avoid main street for pedestrian crossing because its approaching highway speeds now. But on very congested roads like our main street (this being a 250 year old town, where there is no traffic shaping planned, so all through traffic goes down the road that also has the most foot traffic) you aren&#x27;t going to have an easy answer, because slowing down traffic can be just as dangerous when its bumper to bumper for the ~5 mile long road through town and drivers will go mad being forced back to 25mph combined with the immense traffic bottleneck it would reintroduce (the main reason they fast tracked paving the road in the first place - traffic would back up onto the nearby highway offramp because of how bad main street traffic is).<p>I think the reality is that busy streets are just never safe for pedestrians (or bikes, etc). That is why you invest in crosswalks meant to funnel people across them all at once, in centralized places, where traffic is already forced to stop.

There are several other cities where there is a lot of walking traffic.  The speed limits are 25MPH in all of the places you&#x27;d expect them to be[0].  The 85th percentile rule does not apply in these cases nor does it apply on residential roads.  I live on a main subdivision road and folks commonly exceed 25MPH.

Yes, people walk on the county&#x2F;state roads that are set by this rule, but there are proper signals with increased delay times when pedestrians push the magic button (which, on these roads, actually does something -- the walk&#x2F;don&#x27;t walk signals won&#x27;t turn to walk ... ever ... if the button isn&#x27;t pressed).

I stick with the rule of &quot;keep up with traffic&quot; and will speed when that&#x27;s how fast everyone else is going, but I <i>never</i> exceed the speed limit in pedestrian areas and I hope most adults follow suit ... though if my neighborhood is any indication, the <i>worst</i> time for speeding is when parents are heading to the Elementary school (located in my neighborhood!) to pick up their children.

There are various standards for traffic engineering that define various parts of the road based on the speed expected on them: things like lane widths, curve radii, the presence of fences and guards, and more. A 35mph road will have a smaller turn radius than a 65mph highway, for example. These standards have margins built in to them, obstinately because the standards for faster roads are safer. If, for example, you need a 200 foot turn radius to avoid skidding at 45mph, then the road will be designed with a 300 foot turn radius that would prevent skidding at 55mph, and a 55mph road will have a 400 foot turn radius that would prevent skidding at 65mph. However, what happens is that people will drive at the speed that&#x27;s safe, not the speed that&#x27;s posted. People will go 55mph around the 300 foot radius turn that&#x27;s posted for 45mph.<p>The solution to this seems to be to make the roads designed for lower speeds, or to reduce the safety margin, or as other commenters suggest to add traffic calming measures.

I&#x27;m afraid I haven&#x27;t made myself clear; let me see if I can do better.<p>The issue is not the spacing of our metro areas in relation to one another (interregional distances). Rather, we have bad geometry within​our metros (intra-regional distances.) To me, this seems to stem largely from the many ways we&#x27;ve subsidized automotive transit and low density, single family residences since WWII.<p>The difficulty created by our development pattern is that you can almost never gather enough people into one place to justify building a train station, subway station, or even a bus stop. When you can gather them, it&#x27;s normally by those people driving to the stop, and the disappointing crowd that shows up often doesn&#x27;t pull enough weight to get reliable, frequent service to those stops. And as long as those people are going to get in the car anyway, and then have to wait a long time to catch the next bus&#x2F;train, a lot of them are just going to say &quot;the hell with it&quot; and drive to their destination instead.<p>Alternatively, maybe you live in a downtown area where there actually are enough people in close proximity to justify transit stops with a high level of service. If you&#x27;re in a typical American city, you&#x27;ll run into the problem at the other end of your journey. Sure, you easily walked to your stop, but maybe when you get off at your other stop, several miles from the center of town, you&#x27;re still several miles from the store, or the restaurant, or your friend&#x27;s house. And it&#x27;s typically not on streets that are pleasant to walk, because they&#x27;re not very interesting and the cars may be quite fast. So you&#x27;ll have to make your friend pick you up, or pay for Ubers both ways, or walk anyway in an act of defiance against the place you&#x27;ve ended up. None of that sounds great, and if you even did it once, you&#x27;re probably thinking seriously about driving your car next time.<p>And so it turns out that what you really need are at least two places, neither of which really require cars, for transit to be all that helpful. And in the US, we seldom have that, because we have a single center of intensity, with the density decreasing radially in all directions.<p>These places don&#x27;t have to be huge, either. A compact outlying town of 30,000 or so could reasonably have hourly bus service to the major city an hour away. The key is that the town needs to be walkable enough that people can easily get to the bus, and the big city also needs to be navigable without a car.<p>As to intercity: I&#x27;m not saying NYC and LA should have a dedicated rail line between them, but it would certainly be reasonable to have SF, LA, and SD all connected by rail, perhaps high-speed.

Well, for every other type of inherently dangerous activity we are all forced to sign wavers basically saying that we understand and accept said risk and we are willing to take that risk.

Traffic law exists primarily to increase safety on the roads and reduce the risk of accidents.  Now, statistics do show that enforcing traffic laws do actually make the roads safer.  I acknowledge that up front.  But my issue with them is that the overwhelming majority of traffic citations are issued for violations that have caused no harm.  That is, drivers are cited and forced to pay a fine simply for increasing the odds of an accident happening.  The accident need not actually have occurred.  Nowhere else does that shit fly.

I&#x27;ve watched the speed limits increase over the last few years on all but residential roads and though my take is anecdotal, it&#x27;s a fantastic thing as far as I&#x27;m concerned.<p>I used to drive 62 miles round trip to work, worked at home for a bit in between and am now back to about a 30 mile round-trip commute.  Both were split equally on surface and freeway roads.  Back when the speed limits were lower it was generally expected that most drivers -- during rush hour (assuming one could reach the speeds) -- would drive 50 MPH in a 40 and around 55 in a 50.  It always surprised me -- every morning and evening on about a 6-mile stretch of road marked 40 MPH, there wasn&#x27;t a car driving under 50 (and when that rare driver arrived, he was often tailgated so hard that traffic safety decreased considerably for him).  Then, out of the blue, almost every road I took to work was changed to 50 MPH.  Surprisingly, people weren&#x27;t suddenly driving 60 MPH.  I&#x27;m now on a similar commute as I was years ago, taking that same road, and people are consistently driving between 50 and 55 MPH on it.<p>I love our 85th percentile rule.  It makes sense -- that one driver who&#x27;s obeying the speed limit is being tail-gated by everyone else, reducing the distance between him and other cars, which increases accident probability and the relative severity of the accident since it will happen at a higher speed due to reduced braking time.  When everyone is going about the same speed on the road, cars tend to be more spaced out and the relative difference in speed between the two objects colliding affects the severity of the accident.<p>There&#x27;s also a lot of misconceptions about how speed is enforced -- at least in my area -- and what rules exist around speeding.  I&#x27;m not sure if this is still the case, but it used to be that you were legally allowed to exceed the speed limit by 10 MPH on a freeway to overtake a vehicle in the passing lane.  I have family who work in traffic patrol for the county and this topic comes up regularly.  The department they work in encourages targeting people driving in excess of the speed of traffic, not folks who are keeping up with the speed of the cars around them.  Of course, you <i>can</i> be pulled over in this scenario, and you <i>are</i> breaking the law[0], but at least in my area, it&#x27;s not encouraged.  An orderly system is safe, an outlier is unsafe, so they aim for folks who are driving in the left lane on a freeway in low traffic volumes, folks going over 20% of the speed of others and exceeding the speed limit, people jumping solid lines[1] and the huge problem caused by large numbers of people running red lights and failing to yield right-of-way when turning left[2].<p>[0] Both of them will tell you &quot;If I want to pull you over, I can find a reason&quot;.  A common one is those plastic covers&#x2F;dealer advertisements around license plates or things hanging from a rear-view mirror.  Some of the plate variations are legal (but there are <i>very</i> specific rules and almost all of them are not -- it&#x27;s just rarely enforced), but most things hanging from the rear view mirror are obstructions.<p>[1] There are many places on the freeways in Michigan where the lane markers are solid white and for some reason, people don&#x27;t understand that it&#x27;s illegal to change lanes -- that&#x27;s why they&#x27;re solid.  Aside from safety (they&#x27;re put in due to increased blind-spots that make lane changes unsafe), they&#x27;re often located in areas where people are entering the freeway and backups occur.  Folks who panic at merging traffic or just don&#x27;t want to slow down will jump lanes ... causing a worse backup.<p>[2] I realized this is going to sound uncommon to folks who don&#x27;t live here, so pardon the long explanation.  <i>Easily</i> the most common issue on road-ways in my area is people failing to yield when turning left at an intersection (my cousin&#x2F;uncle will tell you this, but if you live here you&#x27;re either already aware of the problem, or you aren&#x27;t realizing you&#x27;re doing it).  Red light running is also more common here than in most of the country because of the frequency with which people encounter one-way intersections.  It&#x27;s legal, everywhere (except NYC and a probably a few other corner cases), to turn <i>left</i> on red when the road is one-way.  Where I live, every road over three lanes (and many under) are engineered using the &quot;Michigan Left&quot; (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Michigan_left\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Michigan_left</a>).  Often, though becoming less common, the &quot;turnaround&quot; is configured so that you can only turn left onto the same road heading in the opposite direction.  Everything&#x27;s fine when this is the case.  However, it&#x27;s grown popular to position these turnaround lanes in places that coincide with large retail business entrances or moderate traffic side-roads.  All bets are off here.  Because people are used to turning left on red in these turn-arounds, they assume they can also, legally, go straight into the side-road&#x2F;business on red.  Go ahead and google for signs telling people <i>not to run red lights</i> ... I couldn&#x27;t find any.  We have <i>several</i> of them on Hall Road in Macomb County.  People are also used to &quot;just going&quot; when it&#x27;s green, but you can&#x27;t do that if the turnaround has traffic entering the road on the other side -- all of that traffic is turning right and has the right-of-way, just like in any other intersection -- left <i>must</i> yield unless they have a green arrow.  I&#x27;ve been <i>honked at</i> on more than a few occasions by other drivers for not just plowing into the intersection, or not running the red to enter a side-street when traffic is clear but the light is red.  Worse, once they put these hybrid side-street&#x2F;turnarounds in, it destroys any advantage that the Michigan Left supposedly provides.
