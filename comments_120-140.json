Yes (to the first question). Because they operate at different layers of the internet stack. ISPs operate at lower layers of the stack than the school. If you fail to see how these are incompatible, please consider the following: Should you be able to choose where your electricity goes to (phone charger, tv, fridge, etc...) ? Why shouldn&#x27;t your electricity provider be allowed this freedom ?<p>2. No (to the first question). Cable television works (conceptually) in a fundamentally different way from the internet. The provider must define its own set of protocols with each channel&#x2F;network and price accordingly. The internet is distributed and free by default, there is an agreement on a common set of protocols and content gets served through these mostly in a federated way. This is different from having to establish a contract with each studio&#x2F;channel and create your own offer (which is not how the internet was designed and intended to work, please read up on the physical layer alternative implementations).\nAlso taking your argument one notch up: different protocols usually mean that you need to consider a different approach and abstraction&#x2F;standard. Do not expect good things if you treat all protocols with the same standard.<p>3. No. Reason: The telephone network works in a different way than the way&#x2F;purpose of the internet. Public switched circuit networks like the telephone network have a inherent hierarchy that is typically not trivial to pass through hence the costs that used to associated with regional&#x2F;international calls and the need to create toll free numbers for special use cases.

The reverse happens to me too, where someone else solves a problem that was hard for me, and it&#x27;s easy to them. Is that a hard problem? It was hard to me, but the problem was easy if I saw it the right way, which I didn&#x27;t.<p>Last year, I came up with a solution to a problem that we&#x27;d been solving sub-optimally for years. My solution is arguably optimal (given a certain set of assumptions) and requires multiple orders of magnitude less code than the previous solution. The solution is the core part of a paper that was recently accepted to a top conference in its field. That sounds like it might be good evidence the problem was a hard problem, but in fact the solution just involved writing down a formula that anyone who was exposed to probability in high school could have written down, if it had occurred to them that the problem could be phrased as a probability problem (that is, the solution involved multiplying a few probabilities and then putting that in a loop). When I described the idea to a co-worker (that you could calculate the exact probability of something, given some mildly unrealistic but not completely bogus assumptions), he immediately worked out the exact same solution. It wasn&#x27;t an objectively hard problem because it&#x27;s a problem many people could solve if you posed the problem to them.

Much more project management and people than technical (it was just a CRUD app) but I came into a project that had been in development for a year or so and stalled out. The development was outsourced and I fell into a position as a liaison between the internal folks at the university that wanted the product and the dev team that had been hired to build it. Sort of a classic issue where the dev team and the stakeholders would talk right past one another. It drove me crazy at the time, but an excellent experience in retrospect.

We&#x27;d get bugs for kernel crashes that appeared related to memory corruption. They frequently ended up being caused by stale DMA addresses in device drivers for (mostly) Infiniband adapters writing into memory that now belonged to some userland process or kernel data structure.<p>How I&#x27;d debug these (it took me a while to be effective in this regard):<p><pre><code>  - Main tool was the AIX kernel debugger (like cutting bone with a butter knife :)\n  - Identify corrupted memory, look for clues like recognizable data structures or pointers in the raw dump that could be cross-checked against symbol maps, etc.\n  - Confirm the alignment of the corrupted memory. Page alignment was a tell-tale sign of errant DMA writes in our system... cache alignment is more mysterious and can be related to CPU design bugs (IBM designs their own POWER processors, and we&#x27;d test on alpha hardware frequently).\n  - Scour the voluminous kernel trace for the physical frame # of the corrupted memory. A typical offending sequence was: \n    1. Frame assigned to adapter for DMA\n    2. Physical memory layout change (we supported live hot-swappable memory arbitrated by the POWER hypervisor)\n    3. Frame allocated for use by page fault handler\n    4. Crash happens\n</code></pre>\nSometimes the root cause was that the device drivers were not properly serialized with the dynamic memory resource subsystem (the hot-swappable memory) and the sequence above happens very quickly (&lt;1 ms). Sometimes the bug took a while to manifest, and the nice story tols above for our page was interspersed with thousands of unrelated activities in the same region of memory.<p>We had to be like a prosecutor and build a strong case to implicate a bug somewhere else. Until then, our team was always on the hook to figure these out.<p>This class of problem was hard because the tools we have at our disposal to collect evidence were quite inadequate, and the amount of data to sift through was enormous. Also, any tool we think might help to sift through all this data needed to already be in the system and in the kernel debugger as a diagnostic command (a crashed system in the debugger cannot be modified in practice). There&#x27;s hundreds of those debugger commands for all kinds of randomly recurring problems we had trouble figuring out.

I started out looking at things with strace and ltrace, had to move deeper and pull out perf and systemtap, but found that it looked like memory access was slower than on the old hardware. I did research on the processor, and found that it was due to the &#x27;Intel Scalable Memory Buffers&#x27;. Since memory first had to be loaded into the buffer before the CPU could access it, things not in the buffer already had higher latency, but things already in the buffer were much more quickly accessed than they would have been previously. I worked with the developers to make up for this performance decrease in other ways. Their application was well suited for using hugepages, but they were not, and TLB pressure was causing performance bottlenecks in other areas. Switching to hugepages prevented TLB pressure, and the application ended up being even more performant on the new platform due to the increased amount of available memory allowing for a large amount of hugepage allocations.<p>- I was consulting for a customer that was running instances on a xen platform. They were having performance issues vs. their old bare metal deployment, and had already done some analysis. They gave me a perf report that was showing a massive amount of time being spent with a specific xen hypercall. I had to dig into the xen source code to figure out exactly what that hypercall was doing, as general public documentation about it was somewhat vague. I was able to determine that it bundled up a bunch of different operations, so it wasn&#x27;t conclusive from that, but it did narrow down the possibilities. It was enough to point me in the right direction, however, and I was able to determine with a little bit of trial and error with some tweaking that it was ultimately related to decisions NUMA was making. It turned out that the customer had thought they were doing NUMA node pinning, and ultimately weren&#x27;t. Interestingly enough, even with pinning, we still saw some of this, and completely disabling NUMA (all the way - not just balancing) actually ended up being needed to fully reclaim the lost performance. I also learned an important lesson in trusting customers - even the ones that know what they&#x27;re doing aren&#x27;t always right, and while I should trust them in general, verifying their answers is important. I discounted investigating NUMA as early on they told me they had their applications pinned to nodes, and I would have otherwise investigated that more quickly and probably solved the issue in less time.","time":1493405787,"type":"comment"},{"by":"gpetukhov","id":14220111,"parent":14219700,"text":"If we are talking about front-end, gradually migrating the Backbonejs&#x2F;Marionettejs codebase to React&#x2F;Redux&#x2F;Webpack.","time":1493392962,"type":"comment"},{"by":"bitwize","id":14221843,"parent":14219700,"text":"Tryna reverse-engineer the bit-banging protocol for a network card using the specs and a Linux driver.<p>Eventually I just gave up.","time":1493404072,"type":"comment"},{"by":"wruza","id":14226001,"parent":14219700,"text":"Debugging undefined behavior related heisenbug.

Meaning I had to document as much as I could (even though I had very little time for this) and I also had to sometimes give more priority to a not-so-important bug (vs a very pressing issue for me), not because it was critical to any feature but because it was making it very painful and hard for a teammate to implement one which in turn would later delay some <i>other</i> feature.<p>And the major reason why there was no actual planning to avoid this as much as possible, was because features were being decided on the go by the top brass on a case by case basis, completely opposite of the original direction I was told we were going to go (which was the information I used to lay down the foundations of the project). I.e. I was told at first that this was going to be just a wrapper script and it ended up being a whole orchestrator including multi-node operations needing result consolidation, a state machine to track down the... uhmm...state of the system, and things like that.<p>So my point is that probably there are several axes of &quot;hardness&quot; in a problem that can be mixed together, and that makes it difficult to compare a problem to another (i.e. over which combination of axes are you comparing one to another?). I guess part of the response to such a question in an interview would be then to explain the context so that it can be more easily understood why was that problem perceived as hard and over which axes. Was it because the problem was an optimization one and the previous code was impossible to work with? was it because the business constrains (as I believe was my case) where surreal? was it because the teammates made it really hard to move forward (e.g. bureaucracy, defensive&#x2F;aggressive coworkers, etc)?<p>And I know we are talking about &quot;technical problems&quot; but I find it increasingly hard (as my career advances) to make a distinction between what is and what is not a technical problem. If the business constrains dictate certain sub-optimal solution must be developed, and that in turn causes technical issues, was that a technical problem? if a teammate is disruptive and introduces sub-par code that later causes bugs that need to be immediately addressed now, was that a technical problem?<p>In my mind they probably all are to some degree just by virtue of in the end influencing whatever technical decisions are being made.

I was working on a device with a microcontroller and it had a sleep mode where the micro would program an RTC, shut itself off and the RTC would trigger the board&#x27;s wakeup circuit when its alarm fired.  I&#x27;d already told the board designer of two or three hardware bugs that somehow (surprise!) turned out to be my software bugs.  So this time I was a little more cautious.  There was a more senior software engineer working with me, and he told me to check the schematic.  I looked at the processor manual and the board schematic, and followed the traces to make sure I was doing it right.  And I just couldn&#x27;t find out what was wrong.  So the senior sw eng said, &quot;well, ok, if you&#x27;re sure, then just probe the RTC pin with a scope.&quot;  Wow.  A o-scope.  WTF is this gloriousness?  So I got to learn a bunch about how to go from the board schematic to the board layout, how to probe, what all the stuff on the scope was about.  Sure enough, the RTC alarm went off on schedule but the trace showed some funny stuff that indicated that there was a design error in the board somewhere (I didn&#x27;t understand the details, but IIRC a cut-and-jump of the prototype made the bug go away).<p>Motto: It&#x27;s never a hardware design bug.  Until it is.<p>#2: This bug I learned a good amount from.  I would see frequent misbehavior in my code where it looked like multiple subsequent sessions were being corrupted somehow, perhaps from a previous session.  I was certain that I was releasing resources from the previous session and destroying all of it.  I watched my code hit my `boost::shared_ptr&lt;foo_t&gt;::reset()` and so clearly it was now gone.  Right?  Well, shared_ptr&lt;&gt; not all it&#x27;s cracked up to be.  So I went back to read about conventional advice about shared_ptr&lt;&gt; and people would frequently suggest boost::weak_ptr&lt;&gt; where appropriate.  I mistakenly thought about these as a dichotomy for some reason.  But that was no good because I couldn&#x27;t share my weak_ptr&lt;&gt; so it&#x27;s not really useful.  Except -- wait -- the vast majority of the time I&#x27;m propagating my shared_ptr to places where they don&#x27;t need to share it beyond themselves.  So my design would actually be better if I shared the shared_ptr as a weak_ptr anywhere other than Right Here.  In doing this redesign, I realized that the weak_ptr promotes itself temporarily by effectively asking &quot;hey is this still allocated somewhere?&quot;  Turns out that other thread using this resource would occasionally take slightly longer and wouldn&#x27;t decrement its shared_ptr until after the new session had started, which would mean that the old resource was never destroyed.  After the redesign in this case where the background thread loses the race it would just fail the weak_ptr&lt;&gt; promotion and harmlessly skip its activity.<p>Motto: shared_ptr&lt;&gt; and weak_ptr&lt;&gt; help preserve an ownership metaphor.

Each one of these had multiple prior failed attempts, and in some cases took me months of thinking before I could find a solution.<p>1.  Qualcomm wanted me to devise a computer vision solution that was more than two orders of magnitude power-efficient than what they had then.  There was a clear justification existing as to why such a drastic improvement was needed.  Nobody had a solution in spite of trying for a long time.  Most laughed it as impossible.  I started by looking for a proof as to why it could not be done if it indeed could not be done.  After some three months of pulling my hair, I started getting glimpses of how to do it.  Some three months later, I could convince myself and a few others that it is doable.  Some three months later, the local team was fully convinced.  Some three months later, the upper management was convinced.  You can read the rest here:  <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.technologyreview.com&#x2F;s&#x2F;603964&#x2F;qualcomm-wants-your-smartphone-to-have-energy-efficient-eyes&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.technologyreview.com&#x2F;s&#x2F;603964&#x2F;qualcomm-wants-you...</a><p>2.  I wanted to solve a specific machine learning and Artificial Intelligence challenge.  I would code for a day or so, and then again run into days of thinking how to proceed further.  E.g., coded a specific parser algorithm for context-free grammars, including conversion to Chomsky normal forms, in 1.5 days including basic testing.  However, what&#x27;s next.  Woke up with new ideas for about ten days in a row.  Conceived Neural Turing Machines back in 2013, about a year before Google came up with their paper on the subject.  (Unsurprisingly, I did not had that name in mind for it back in 2013.)  I also did not get an actual opportunity to work on it, as a result of which I am still not sure if I could have actually done it.<p>3.  Needed to make a very sensitive capacitance measurement circuit, trying to get to atto Farad scale floating capacitance even with pF scale parasitic capacitance to ground.  The noise and power requirements were very challenging.  After about three months of seeking inputs from the team lead without hearing a solution, I ended up coming up with a solution.  I later discovered that the technique was already known in RF circles, though only a few were aware of it.  Capacitance measurement circuits with such sensitivity did not show up in the market for several years.  (My effort was target at using inside a bigger system.)<p>4.  I was working on measuring bistable MEMS devices.  The static response of these was well understood.  However, so far, the dynamic response was only measured by the team; there was no theoretical explanation behind it.  We invited several professors working in the field to give seminars to us, and asked questions for this, but never heard back a good answer.  A physicist colleague found an IEEE paper giving the non-linear differential equations behind it, which worked, but yet provided no insights into the device behavior, and took time to solve numerically.  I wanted a good enough analytical solution.  I kept on trying whenever I had time-opportunity, while the physicist colleague kept on telling me to give up.  Six months later.  I woke up with a solution in mind, and rushed to the office at 7 am to discuss with whosoever was there at work at that time.  The optics guy I found did not fully understand it, but did not find it crazy either.  A few hours later, the physicist friend confirmed my insight by running some more numerical solutions.  I could then soon find tight enough upper and lower bounds, and the whole thing fit the measurements so well that most people thought it was just a &quot;curve fit&quot;.  (It was pure theory vs. measurements plotted together.)<p>5.  I proposed making pixel-level optical measurements on mirasol displays using a high-resolution camera to watch those pixels after subjecting them to complex drive waveforms.  Two interns were separately given the task (surprisingly without telling me), and both failed to develop algorithms for pixel-level measurements.  Later a junior employee worked on it, was unable to develop pixel-level measurements still, though was able to get it to work at lower resolutions.  The system took about 40 minutes of offline processing in Matlab.  Later, a high-profile problem came up where pixel-level measurements were a must, and I was directly responsible for solving.  Solved in one day.  Processed images taken in real-time, not 40 minutes.  The system stayed in deployment for years to come.<p>6.  We had bistable MEMS devices, and there was a desire to make tri-stable MEMS devices.  Several people at the company attempted it, including a respected Principal Engineer, but no one could figure how to even start.  I could not figure either at the outset, but started bottoms up from Physics and using Wolfram Mathematica to create visualizations around the thing.  And bingo.  In a few days, I had not only figured how to make these tri-stable MEMS devices, but also multiple schemes of driving them.  My VP&#x27;s reaction was &quot;Alok, you should patent that diagram itself&quot;, given the clarity it had brought on the table.<p>7.  We were creating grayscale&#x2F;color images using half-toning.  A famous algorithm, Floyd Steinberg, works very well for still images but has lots of artifacts for videos.  An PhD student working in the field was brought in as an intern, nevertheless, the results were not great.  The team also tried binary search algorithms to find the best outputs iteratively, however, it was not implementable in real-time as needed.  I was interested in the problem, but was not getting time to give it a fresh thought that it needed, until one day.  A few days later, the problem was solved.  I developed some insights into it and just had the solution coded, to the surprise of people who had spent months working on it.<p>I could go on writing about more cases.","time":1493409486,"type":"comment"}],"parent":14218559,"text":"&gt; What is the hardest technical problem you have run into?<p>I never seem to find a quick good answer for this.<p>Maybe I just almost never work on REAL hard things.<p>So my question to you, HNers, is :<p>What is the hardest technical problem YOU have run into?<p>I am really interested to know what you would consider &#x27;hardest&#x27;.. \nIt&#x27;s probably not going to be something like &#x27;I changed the css property value from &quot;display: block&quot; to &quot;display: inline-block&quot;..&#x27;","time":1493390331,"type":"comment"},{"by":"tn135","id":14222385,"kids":[{"by":"cookiecaper","id":14222541,"kids":[{"by":"tn135","id":14230420,"parent":14222541,"text":"Yes.

I like to start talking backwards from their resume, and say &quot;OK, Job A. What were you focused on there? Your description mentions technologies B,C,D. How did you apply them?&quot;<p>You then just take it from there, pick up on the things they discuss to get into the technicalities. Ask them hypotheticals. Ask them how that technology could apply to a different problem set. Ask them about things that annoyed you specifically about those technologies in the past and how they addressed&#x2F;resolved them. etc.<p>This is the best way to interview in my experience. It keeps the pressure low, it doesn&#x27;t waste time on rehearsed answers, it doesn&#x27;t waste time on whiteboarding unless it comes up (a very basic takehome project (30 minutes) should be given pre-interview), it lets the person discuss their experience and provide real feedback about the things they&#x27;ve learned. It gives them the opportunity to discuss their technical habits, values, and interests. It reveals the most about the candidate in the minimal amount of time.<p>So many of my colleagues would lock up when they&#x27;d go in to interview people and not know what to do. They&#x27;d sit there and just expect the candidate to know what they wanted to see and carry the whole thing. They&#x27;d print off a list of questions that they found from a site about how to interview people, or they&#x27;d give them a code trivia quiz that is a massive waste of time for everyone.<p>All of that is very silly and misses the point.

That&#x27;s why families get bumped so easily.  And then there are connections.  The passenger who will miss subsequent connections is an expensive person to bump.

The man was travelling in a group (his wife was with him) and didn&#x27;t have any checked luggage, else we would have heard about it being offloaded or returned to him in hospital, and had no connections to make.

Once he explained it it was totally obvious. The biggest time waster is waiting for people in front of you to finish putting up their luggage so that they step out of the ail and you can get to your seat. The boarding strategy most airlines employ of boarding people at the same time who sit in the same part of the plane minimizes opportunities for passengers to put their luggage away in parallel. So it&#x27;s actually a actively negative boarding strategy. Boarding in random order would be better. Ideally you would space people out from different sections if the airplane and within reach group someone from the back of the plane would board first. They&#x27;d all arrive at their seats in parallel and start putting their luggage up at the same time and then the next group repeats the procedure. I think what Southwest does is interesting because it leaves the process in essence to the passengers. I&#x27;ve seen it go both ways where someone takes the first free seat and starts putting up their luggage, blocking everyone else from making progress. Sometimes people are great and walk by available seats top the middle and now people can start putting their stuff away in parallel.<p>Ever since I listened to that I cannot stop thinking about it when boarding is slow and get upset about the airline making things actively inefficient.

That...and my Bachelors only goes so far.<p>That said, I <i>think</i> you are conflating a couple of economic principles.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s necessary to maximize total surplus as well. If someone wanted to get on the plane, and they took off with a seat empty, that&#x27;s a deadweight loss.<p>I think you are confusing utility [1] with surplus somewhat here.  If someone wanted to get on and they took off with an empty seat that is a loss in Utility.  If the airline turns around and sells that seat to the new person that increases Producer Surplus (and conversely decreasing Consumer Surplus) to increase Utility.<p>I don&#x27;t think this situation (empty seat) is DWL in the traditional sense [2].  The traditional DWL scenario is when producers <i>could</i> supply more but don&#x27;t because of pricing constraints or other artificial ceilings&#x2F;floors.  It is definitely a marketing allocation inefficiency which results in Utility loss and I am kind of interested to see if there are better quantifications of this loss...but it isn&#x27;t a DWL in surplus technically.<p>&gt; Everyone then is better off. In fact, on a lot of flights, you can probably find multiple people to bump with just a token payment -- they&#x27;d rather stay another day.<p>It&#x27;s totally possible that everyone <i>can</i> be better off.  The issue isn&#x27;t about when everyone <i>is</i> better off...it&#x27;s when the system breaks down and you have situations where no one wants to make that trade.<p>&gt; The bumped guy is happy to have the money, the last minute guy is happy to be on the plane, and the airline is happy to make $4700 extra.<p>This is an example of maximizing producer surplus.  In my mind it&#x27;s a variation of Price Discimination [3].  And while this overall beneficial situation is plausible, it isn&#x27;t really <i>overbooking</i>.<p>For me, <i>overbooking</i> is basically selling more goods than you actually have and playing on the statistics trying to bank on people not making the flight.  If you sell 30 seats and 5 people don&#x27;t show, you take off with 25 people on board.  If you sell 35 seats and 5 don&#x27;t show, you take off with a full flight <i>and</i> pocket some additional revenue from the 5 no shows.<p>Now there is a lot of gray area since most no shows are from missed connections and so some of that additional revenue can go back into the system to allow for cheaper cancellation fees as well as accommodating rescheduling costs for these missed connections.  But in general I suspect that producer surplus increases more than the gain in consumer utility.<p>&gt; This works even better with a name-your-price bump question on checkin for flights that are oversold. Even if it&#x27;s nonbinding, the airline now knows that it has willing passengers to bump and can keep selling tickets.<p>This is again, Price Discrimination but now adding information imbalance in order to help the airline more effectively Price Discriminate thereby maximizing their Producer Surplus.<p>Technically the United situation isn&#x27;t the result of <i>overbooking</i> anyway...but I still think the practice warrants scrutiny.  United&#x27;s recent announcement to increase payouts and mileage compensation is testament to the fact that there was Producer Surplus to spare.<p>Like I said, all of this is speculative discussion and there is a lot of gray area.  It is also plausible that overbooking results in maximizing Utility and an even handed redistribution of benefits to both producers and consumers.  But I believe Producers are driven by incentives...and they don&#x27;t have strong incentives to share the benefits of overbooking altruistically back to the consumer.<p>I fly from SFO - PDX every other weekend and consistently, no matter how early I book, Virgin America flights are cheaper than United and Virgin doesn&#x27;t overbook whereas United does.  Generally speaking, if United were even slightly returning the added revenue from overbooking to the consumer shouldn&#x27;t their flights be cheaper than non-overbooked competitors?<p>Again this observation and subsequent question is anecdotal and broad...but I like it for FFT.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikibooks.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Principles_of_Economics&#x2F;Utility\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikibooks.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Principles_of_Economics&#x2F;Utilit...</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Deadweight_loss\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Deadweight_loss</a><p>[3] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;thismatter.com&#x2F;economics&#x2F;price-discrimination.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;thismatter.com&#x2F;economics&#x2F;price-discrimination.htm</a>","time":1493402996,"type":"comment"}],"parent":14215403,"text":"It&#x27;s necessary to maximize total surplus as well.

Short of the apocalypse, you&#x27;re going to find plenty of takers on any flight for $10k, even if it&#x27;s a multiple day delay.  The people who take the payoff are better off -- if they weren&#x27;t, they wouldn&#x27;t have taken the voluntary deal to fly later.

The bet SWA is making is that the revenue gain from overbooking is smaller than the consequential losses from bad publicity. Just think about the downside to United based on their share price alone, and now the increased focus that is on the &#x27;good conduct&#x27; w.r.t bumping passengers in the light of it.<p>The maths of overbooking is that if you have 100 bookings on a 100 seater flight and 97 passengers show up then perhaps you could have sold 103 tickets and still not have to bump anyone. In this case you have increased revenue by 3% without an increase in costs. This can either manifest itself in an increased profit or, on a competitive route, lower ticket prices.<p>Of course, there will be variations in the number of people who show up and this can lead to more passengers arriving at the airport than there are seats on the plane. In this case, there is a cost to the airline, and perhaps in this big optimisation problem there are some airlines that see a bigger payoff in overbooking and bumping than avoiding overselling and minimising bumping.<p>I don&#x27;t know about budget airlines, but full service you might expect somewhere in the region of 5% overselling. For budget, I would expect it to be higher as tickets are cheaper so passengers have less to lose by not showing up.<p>Nonetheless, even if it were a 1-2% increase in revenue, it would have a much higher impact on profitability. On a budget route, you could have $500 profit per flight, say a couple of dollars per passenger.

Mental qualities peculiar to human-like motivational structures , such as love and hate, will not be required for intelligent behavior, but we could probably program computers to exhibit them if we wanted to, because our common sense notions about them translate readily into certain program and data structures.

Capsaicin is the active component of chili peppers that produces a burning sensation in any tissue it comes in contact with. How does this signal get conveyed? There are three classes of nerve fiber in our central and peripheral nervous system – the ‘C’ type of nerve fiber are the ones that are stimulated by capsaicin – specifically the molecule binds to the vanilloid receptors (VR-1, TRPV1) on the nerve endings of the C-fibers. These receptors are ligand-gated ion channels that are closed in the absence of capsaicin. When they are stimulated by capsaicin, they open and allow an influx of sodium and calcium ions, which initiate an action potential across the fibers. This action potential is what allows us to feel the burn. Normally, physical heat stimulates these receptors. However, capsaicin can also interact with these receptors and activate proteins that cause the same signal to be transmitted to the brain into thinking that it is being burned.<p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogs.discovermagazine.com&#x2F;scienceandfood&#x2F;2017&#x2F;01&#x2F;17&#x2F;capsaicin&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogs.discovermagazine.com&#x2F;scienceandfood&#x2F;2017&#x2F;01&#x2F;17&#x2F;...</a>","time":1493463412,"type":"comment"}],"parent":14225335,"text":"I was expecting endorphin release to come up in the Guardian article and was surprised when it didn&#x27;t.

With time the pain goes away and you still get the endorphins, although you may seek out an increasingly strong dose to boost the endorphin response.<p>Not all Americans think this is a good deal.  Older people are less likely to make this initial investment and endure the initial pain.  The same is true for uneducated people (adjusting for ethnicity), who both are less likely to know it will end up being a source of pleasure and who on average have higher discount rates.  What other predictions can be made?  If you and your country are too obsessed with dairy you will be led away from spicy food, one way or the other.  Milk usually counteracts the pleasing effects of chilies.</i>","time":1493447719,"type":"comment"},{"by":"SerLava","id":14224740,"parent":14224078,"text":"Chili peppers can be used to compensate for otherwise poor flavor, but that is certainly not the only use case.

The clients convert their data requirements into a query, and the GraphQL server returns the exact data you need, no more, no less. It requires some discipline when it comes to evolving the schema over time, but it works really really well. And when implemented intelligently has comparable performance to hand-crafted endpoints (I&#x27;ve written about how to approach this here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dev-blog.apollodata.com&#x2F;optimizing-your-graphql-request-waterfalls-7c3f3360b051\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dev-blog.apollodata.com&#x2F;optimizing-your-graphql-requ...</a>)<p>When you experience the front-end workflow of using a library like Relay or Apollo (both are GraphQL clients) and having perfect synchronisation with UI and data, it&#x27;s a really magical moment.

On application layer you are mostly on your own anyway, there&#x27;s not a lot things one could standardize. There are some exceptions, like the standardization of Webdav on top of HTTP, but most applications have their own specific set of requirements. If we are talking about standardization without meaning offical-standardization, then we can argue that grpc provides a more rigid (standardized) model for an application than the definition of some ad-hoc APIs: It is standardized how APIs and exchanged data types are defined (.proto files), how they can be accessed and how data is transferred over the wire (mapping to HTTP).
