However, it doesn&#x27;t really seem to play well with React&#x27;s architecture. For instance, React does not have any built in support for computed properties. Therefore, if I am returning data from the central store through a function on a component that calls a getter from the store, the component will not update if the central state changes during the component&#x27;s life cycle. Of course I could write a polling function or some sort of watcher method that binds the computed properties to component state, but that sounds like a mess. At a certain point after trying to get React to act more like like Vue, I have to ask myself why I&#x27;m not just using Vue in the first place.<p>Regarding you statement about abstraction layers, separation of concerns, and re-usability:<p>If I want a generic and re-usable component I just won&#x27;t give it any data state. It may have local presentation state, but all data will be passed to it from a parent. Any operations the component allows will simply emit events. Both Vue and React are equally suitable for this and I have no complaints about either for generic components.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how being able to read central state in any component violates separation of concerns, however. The store is still handing all mutations to application state in Redux or Vuex. The difference with Vuex is that You do not need to have a chain of callbacks for dispatching actions, you do not need &quot;connected containers&quot;, and you do not need to pass state through components in a tree that do not require that state. For instance, say I have a user profile page. This page displays user information received from a REST detail endpoint. Simple enough, right? I just have a `UserProfileContainer` where I define functions for fetching the user object from the API and then getters for retrieving that state. Now, I decide that I want to display a user&#x27;s recent activities in a feed on the same page. Do I add to my `UserProfileContainer` to pass state  down to the new feed component and it&#x27;s children, or do I define the feed component as a new container? Or, do I define an intermediary `UserProfileLayout` component that is not a container and handles delegating state passed to it from the `UserProfileContainer`? If I do that I am passing application state through a component that has no use for it and I have to define an addional callback to propagate the event back to `UserProfileContainer`. Or maybe I should use `UserProfileContainer` itself to delegate state to the `UserInfo` and `UserFeed` components? How you compose this theoretical interface is probably defined by the structure of the rest of the application.

Last year I signed on with a new project where I was in charge of both front and back-end work. Because of this, I was introduced to the modern front-end ecosystem and all of its intricacies. We&#x27;ve come a long way from jQuery. After evaluating many different front end libraries against project requirements it came down to using either Vue or React. We chose React because of its wider adoption. Eventually we hired on 2 front-end developers so I could focus on the server side of things. Well, here comes the project deadline and I&#x27;m having to pick up slack on the front-end. Now, since the new front-end devs re-wrote the entire front-end, I am struggling to understand why they structured it the way they did. They insist that having huge containers passing state down through multiple dumb components is the best way to structure the application. I feel like it introduces unnecessary complexity. Because our front-end devs have more experience in front-end development(obviously), I need to trust their judgment. I hope that helps you understand my frustrations.<p>&gt;You _can_ even directly import the store into your component files and reference it directly, although that&#x27;s discouraged for several reasons (per the Redux FAQ at <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;redux.js.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;faq&#x2F;StoreSetup.html#store-setup-mul..\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;redux.js.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;faq&#x2F;StoreSetup.html#store-setup-mul...</a>. ).<p>Yes, I definitely want to steer clear of this pattern.<p>&gt;Third, you shouldn&#x27;t need to &quot;propagate an event through 5 different callbacks&quot;.

I found it particularly helpful for this use case because it made diagram re-use, and updating existing diagrams when architecture changes are planned, extremely easy. We also used Confluence, for which there is a PlantUML plugin that allows you to insert your UML markup directly into a doc, which is then rendered by Confluence when someone views the page. \nI threw together a set of macros and sprites for AWS architecture and deployment diagrams, which I&#x27;ve put on GitHub[0] for anyone who finds it useful.

For example, HIPAA regulations require PHI to be encrypted in transit and at rest, contrary to what this post tries to scare readers with. In general, healthcare organizations tend towards being extraordinarily conservative when it comes to security and require providers to jump through unnecessary hoops tO access data. Citrix seems to be deployed widely across hospitals, which is a pretty blunt security iinstrument for things like even access to email. It&#x27;s true that there is tons of work to be done to improve security and access to healthcare data, but for pretty much none of the reasons stated here.

Sure, you could probably do the same yourself, but think about it: you will be handling so many corner cases with such a system that if there were a prebuilt service already doing that work for you (and which is improving quite rapidly) you could probably build it out faster with the external service.<p>3. There is also enough flexibility where you can add webhooks (like the author has done) and basically put a lot of business logic into your chatbot.<p>4. Assuming API.AI will soon be acquiring some of the ML knowledge which Google already has, it is reasonable to expect that the intent mapping (the process of figuring out what the user said) will only keep getting better.<p>Having said that, here are some advantages of rolling out your own:<p>1. You don&#x27;t typically get the full picture of what is going on under the hood with an external service. Unlike the case where you write your own code, this means when things fail (and they will), you sometimes don&#x27;t know what is the cause, and worse, how to get around it.<p>2. There is always the inherent risk that the service you rely on might shut down some day :-(<p>3. The current tooling around moving your chatbot from staging to production in API.AI is fraught with risk. I don&#x27;t know if it is the same with the other ones too. If you roll out your own chatbot, you don&#x27;t have such issues.<p>4. There are also some features which have been added to API.AI which are sort of all or nothing. A good example is the small-talk feature which you can import into an agent. The trouble is, you cannot really customize it much, so when it doesn&#x27;t give you the behavior you expect, it can become a bit of a liability.<p>Hope that helps!","time":1493215206,"type":"comment"}],"parent":14200446,"text":"In this case, why even use api.ai?

If you are planning on leveraging a chatbot as opposed to a mobile app or website, having some kind of presence of Facebook messenger could increase user engagement because of the lower amount of friction from switching or downloading new apps to interact with a business. It&#x27;s especially relevant when you consider that social platforms are used for customer support more and more so augmenting this channel with some kind of automated support option makes sense from an ROI perspective.<p>2. Simpler user experiences. Now this one is definitely idealistic, and where a lot of hype is coming from. But, the general idea is to take websites and mobile apps and create a single interface into the content&#x2F;services where the hope is that users will have a lower learning curve because they can use everyday language. In reality, bots that I&#x27;ve seen are mostly text based IVRs that confuse the users, and don&#x27;t make experiences any more enjoyable.<p>3. Personalization and NL analytics. Assuming your chatbot allows for  free form text. You could potentially build more comprehensive profiles of users by mining their conversations and behavior. You could certainly do this today with web and app metrics, twitter posts, support emails, and transcribed voice calls, but now you have a Facebook or social profile tied to a customer which is another dimension of data you can use where in the past you may have had no linkage between your app accounts vs a users social profile.<p>By no means a comprehensive list, and if you incorporate voice recognition on top of a &quot;chatbot&quot;, you can provide an easier way for users to interact with systems when they may not be able to use their hands (driving, lost an appliance remote, running)","time":1493216728,"type":"comment"},{"by":"intous","id":14203144,"parent":14202990,"text":"It depends on use case.

This analysis purports to show that broadband Internet service is an information service because it provides users the &quot;capability for generating, acquiring, storing, transforming, processing, retrieving, utilizing, or making available information via telecommunications.&quot; The argument given is that broadband Internet service <i>allows</i> users to do all these things. However, this is not the same as <i>providing the capability</i> to do these things. To see why, consider that providing users Internet services over dialup phone lines also allows users to do all these things; but the phone lines themselves are telecommunications services, not information services. Why? Because providing the user dialup Internet, by itself, does <i>not</i> provide them the capability to do all these things. That capability is provided by the endpoints: the users&#x27; computers, and the computers hosting the Internet services that the users connect to.<p>Exactly the same is true of broadband Internet services provided by ISPs: by themselves, they do <i>not</i> provide users the capability to do all these things. They only provide connections between computers at the endpoints that provide those capabilities. It is the services provided by the Internet hosts that users connect to that are &quot;information services&quot;. The broadband Internet services that allow users to connect to those hosts are telecommunications services, and should be regulated as such.<p>ISPs object to analyses like the one above because they claim that they also provide the actual information services--in other words, they also provide Internet hosts that function as email servers, web servers, etc. But it is obvious that those services are <i>separate</i> from the broadband connection services provided by those same ISPs, because users can make use of the latter without making use of the former at all. I am such a user: I use the broadband Internet connection provided by my ISP, but I do not use any of the information services they provide; I do not use their email, their web hosting, etc. I use other Internet hosts provided by other companies for those services. The fact that ISPs offer information services as well as telecommunications services does not make their telecommunications services into information services; an ISP&#x27;s choice of business model cannot change the nature of a particular service it provides. Broadband Internet connections are obviously a telecommunications service, and should be regulated as such, regardless of what other services ISPs would like to bundle with them. The FCC should continue to regulate broadband Internet service as a telecommunications service.","time":1493322349,"type":"comment"},{"by":"pdelbarba","id":14214064,"kids":[{"by":"idbehold","id":14214089,"kids":[{"by":"jacquesm","id":14214505,"kids":[{"by":"nebabyte","id":14218595,"parent":14214505,"text":"I&#x27;ve been correlating this sort of anecdata with countries that meet other metrics I&#x27;d ideally have met on nomadlist (its &#x27;internet metrics&#x27; don&#x27;t really go into granularities like cost, net freedoms, or so on), I&#x27;ll add Romania to the running list.

For one,\nbroadband Internet users do not typically specify the “points” between and among which information is\nsent online. Instead, routing decisions are based on the architecture of the network, not on consumers’\ninstructions, and consumers are often unaware of where online content is stored. Domain names must be\ntranslated into IP addresses (and there is no one-to-one correspondence between the two). Even IP\naddresses may not specify where information is transmitted to or from because caching servers store and\nserve popular information to reduce network loads.<p>This is absurd.

Please feel free to pass this on to your elected representatives, or anyone else who you think should see it.<p>Re: Notice of Proposed Rulemaking – WC Docket No. 17-108<p>The subject notice seeks comment on the analysis provided. The following comments are hereby submitted.<p>Paragraph 27 purports to show that broadband Internet service is an information service because it provides users the &quot;capability for generating, acquiring, storing, transforming, processing, retrieving, utilizing, or making available information via telecommunications.&quot; The argument given is that broadband Internet service <i>allows</i> users to do all these things. However, this is not the same as <i>providing the capability</i> to do these things. To see why, consider that providing users Internet services over dialup phone lines also allows users to do all these things; but the phone lines themselves are telecommunications services, not information services. Why? Because providing the user dialup Internet, by itself, does <i>not</i> provide them the capability to do all these things. That capability is provided by the endpoints: the users&#x27; computers, and the computers hosting the Internet services that the users connect to.<p>Exactly the same is true of broadband Internet services provided by ISPs: by themselves, they do <i>not</i> provide users the capability to do all these things. They only provide connections between computers at the endpoints that provide those capabilities. It is the services provided by the Internet hosts that users connect to that are &quot;information services&quot;. The broadband Internet services that allow users to connect to those hosts are telecommunications services, and should be regulated as such.<p>ISPs object to analyses like the one above because they claim that they also provide the actual information services--in other words, they also provide Internet hosts that function as email servers, web servers, etc. But it is obvious that those services are <i>separate</i> from the broadband connection services provided by those same ISPs, because users can make use of the latter without making use of the former at all. I am such a user: I use the broadband Internet connection provided by my ISP, but I do not use any of the information services they provide; I do not use their email, their web hosting, etc. I use other Internet hosts provided by other companies for those services. The fact that ISPs offer information services as well as telecommunications services does not make their telecommunications services into information services; an ISP&#x27;s choice of business model cannot change the nature of a particular service it provides. Broadband Internet connections are obviously a telecommunications service, and should be regulated as such, regardless of what other services ISPs would like to bundle with them.<p>Paragraph 28 asks whether &quot;offering Internet access is precisely what makes the service capable of &#x27;generating, acquiring, storing, transforming, processing, retrieving, utilizing, or making available information&#x27; to consumers?&quot; The answer to this question, as noted above, is no, because all of those capabilities are not provided by the mere fact of Internet access; they are provided by the endpoint computers that implement those capabilities. The question of how those computers are connected to each other, which is the relevant question for the purpose of determining whether broadband Internet service is a telecommunications service, is a separate question from the question of what capabilities the endpoint computers provide.<p>Paragraph 28 also asks whether consumers could &quot;access these online services using traditional telecommunications services like telephone service or point-to-point special access?&quot; Obviously the answer to this question will depend on what connectivity the providers of such telecommunications services choose to provide. But that is a different question from the question of what the nature of a particular service is. Again, the question of how computers are connected to each other is separate from the question of what capabilities the endpoint computers provide.<p>Paragraph 29 attempts to argue, in effect, that if most Internet users rely on their ISPs for <i>any</i> additional service beyond the bare fact of Internet connectivity--for example, DNS--then broadband Internet service must be an information service. Paragraph 29 also claims that the ISP, not the user, &quot;specifies the points between and among which information will be transmitted&quot;, because, first, users only specify domain names, not IP addresses, and second, users do not make the routing decisions that determine the specific path information packets take through the network. Neither of these considerations affects the proper classification of broadband Internet service as a telecommunications service. Users might only specify domain names, but the <i>service</i> of translating domain names into IP addresses is provided by an endpoint--a DNS server--not by the bare provision of an Internet connection. (And even if the ISP typically provides this endpoint, that is still a separate service from the service of providing an Internet connection, and, as above, bundling the two together cannot change the nature of the latter.) Once the DNS service has provided an IP address corresponding to a domain name to the user&#x27;s computer, the user&#x27;s computer, not the network, specifies that IP address as the target of information packets, so once again, it is an endpoint, not the network itself, that determines where the information goes. And routing information packets, in and of itself, is not an information service, because it does not change the information being routed; it just accomplishes the information transmission specified by the user, from one endpoint to another. The intermediate routers that pass on information packets are not endpoints: they are not specified by the user as the targets of any information, and they do not provide any of the capabilities that make an endpoint a provider of an information service.<p>The analysis of Paragraph 29 also fails to take into account that, if it were valid, it would apply equally well to traditional phone service, which is admitted to be a telecommunications service. Users specify phone numbers to dial, but that does not require knowledge of the physical location of the target phone (and the user will often not have such knowledge), nor does it specify the route that will be taken by the information transmitted by the call. Also, traditional phone service includes directory service (411) and other &quot;add-ons&quot; that go beyond the basic provision of a connection. What makes those &quot;add-ons&quot; telecommunications services rather than information services is that they are for the purpose of facilitating the connection (or facilitating the refusal of connections which are not desired), rather than acting on the information exchanged between the users at the endpoints.<p>Paragraph 30 attempts to argue that network management activities such as firewalling and IPV4 - IPV6 translation constitute changing the information being transmitted. This analysis fails in two ways. First, refusing to transmit information (e.g., a firewall blocking content deemed to be harmful) is not the same as changing it. Refusing to provide a connection to a user is not the same as changing the information transmitted by the user. Second, the &quot;information&quot; which is changed by such activities as IPV4 - IPV6 translation is not the information sent by the user; it is network management information which is <i>added</i> to the information packets specified by the user, outside the user&#x27;s control and indeed without the knowledge of most users (since most users are not familiar with the technical details of IP networking). These network management activities are no different from the activities routinely performed by phone networks to route calls--indeed, today the same physical infrastructure is often used to perform both functions, since the phone service backbone and the Internet backbone are in many cases the same networks. Similar remarks apply to services such as filtering by firewalls: phone networks can block calls from certain numbers, for example. Again, the key distinction which the analysis in Paragraph 30 fails to make is between &quot;add-on&quot; services that are for the purpose of facilitating connections, and services that are for the purpose of manipulating the information exchanged by the users at the endpoints. Only the latter are information services; the former are part of the telecommunications service that provides the connection.<p>In the light of all of the above considerations, the FCC should continue to regulate broadband Internet service as a telecommunications service.","time":1493330925,"type":"comment"},{"by":"pdonis","id":14214323,"kids":[{"by":"pdonis","id":14215279,"parent":14214323,"text":"Updated comment here:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=14215198\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=14215198</a>","time":1493331651,"type":"comment"}],"parent":14213970,"text":"Further comment after reading more of the notice:<p>The draft also seeks comment in Paragraph 28 on whether &quot;offering Internet access is precisely what makes the service capable of &#x27;generating, acquiring, storing, transforming, processing, retrieving, utilizing, or making available information&#x27; to consumers?&quot; The answer to this question, as noted above, is no, because all of those capabilities are not provided by the mere fact of Internet access; they are provided by the endpoint computers that implement those capabilities. The question of how those computers are connected to each other is a separate question from the question of what capabilities they provide.<p>Paragraph 28 also asks whether consumers could &quot;access these online services using traditional telecommunications services like telephone service or point-to-point special access?&quot; Obviously the answer to this question will depend on what connectivity the providers of such telecommunications services choose to provide. But that is a different question from the question of what the nature of a particular service is.<p>Paragraph 29 attempts to argue, in effect, that if most Internet users rely on their ISPs for <i>any</i> additional service beyond the bare fact of Internet connectivity--for example, DNS--then broadband Internet service must be an information service. Paragraph 29 also claims that ISPs, not users, &quot;specifies the points between and among which information will be transmitted&quot;, because, first, users only specify domain names, not IP addresses, and second, users do not make the routing decisions that determine the specific path information packets take through the network. Neither of these considerations affects the proper classification of broadband Internet service as a telecommunications service. Users might only specify domain names, but the <i>service</i> of translating domain names into IP addresses is provided by an endpoint--a DNS server--somewhere, not by the bare provision of an Internet connection. (And even if the ISP typically provides this endpoint, that is still a separate service from the service of providing an Internet connection, and, as above, bundling the two together cannot change the nature of the latter.) Once the DNS service has provided an IP address to the user&#x27;s computer, corresponding to a domain name, the user&#x27;s computer, not the network, specifies that IP address as the target of information packets, so once again, it is an endpoint, not the network itself, that determines where the information goes.

As long as what you are doing is not blatantly illegal (writing to memory addresses that do not exist, etc) then it pretty much is just a single flat memory space that you can do anything with, and on non-ECC devices memory is only zeroed on a cold startup.<p>Think &quot;microcontroller&quot; here, not memory like you&#x27;d get in desktop-land.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;1305.7383.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;1305.7383.pdf</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;petsymposium.org&#x2F;2017&#x2F;papers&#x2F;issue2&#x2F;paper10-2017-2-source.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;petsymposium.org&#x2F;2017&#x2F;papers&#x2F;issue2&#x2F;paper10-2017-2-s...</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cryptome.org&#x2F;2013&#x2F;09&#x2F;gpu-keylogger.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cryptome.org&#x2F;2013&#x2F;09&#x2F;gpu-keylogger.pdf</a>","time":1493319249,"type":"comment"},{"by":"sofaofthedamned","id":14213745,"kids":[{"by":"robarr","id":14213957,"parent":14213745,"text":"For the uninformed...<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Blitter\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Blitter</a>","time":1493320443,"type":"comment"}],"parent":14213553,"text":"Upvote for the term blitter which reminds me of my Amiga and Atari days...","time":1493318307,"type":"comment"}],"parent":14213088,"text":"Unfortunately, despite GPUs being ubiquitous, they get very little use in the desktop&#x2F;mobile space, aside from games.

There is something deeper than funding journalists.  Ideologies (special interest groups) are far too powerful and connected through other means to simply disappear.  They will collaborate and infiltrate anything that has visibility and a reputation.<p>Will Wikipedia shut out these ideologies? Of course not.  It will favour some ideologies over others and you at straight back to where we are now.  This was well summarised in the article about WWIII yesterday on HN. The crux of the WWIII article covered all forms of bias, but ideologies still equally applied to the pitfalls identified.<p>Let&#x27;s say for a minute the Wikimedia board put one of each ideologist type on the board (1 for each religion, sex, ethnicity, colour of skin, sexual orientation, etc).  It would exclude some ideologies (eg. ISIS) and favour others (eg. Christianity).  Subgroups would form among the wider group and political correctness would kick in (especially if it stroked the preferences of editors, founders, lead sponsors, vocal readers, etc).<p>As somebody else mentioned here, Wikipedia is a basket case on anything controversial. Often, one side of a topic is watered down by mods with an agenda and the opposing view is given carte blanche.  I read the comments by editors after I saw how extreme some of the articles were. Editors for one side were exasperated at the lack of impartiality.<p>I don&#x27;t have an answer.  Simplisticly, you could start with egalitarianism and exclude special interest groups. Reject political correctness.  If it is divisive (eg. Special interest groups), then block them all.  However, this isn&#x27;t tenable and limits some worthy&#x2F;essential discussion.  As soon as you allow divisiveness (eg. Special interest groups), you are destined to fail.<p>Even if egalitarianism won out (ie. no divisiveness), the authors would still inject their own prejudices.  I believe wired tries to be egalitarian, but, the authors who support certain ideologies still slip in one-sided comments frequently. They do this sufficiently frequently that I can usually pick the ideologies supported by their staff.  To their credit, they are very mild compared to most other outlets.<p>There are conflicting needs, too many politicised groups, too much to gain&#x2F;lose. Unless the wikimedia leadership has a plan to stop the failures inherent in Wikipedia, this will fail too.  Power struggles and division will ultimately (I suspect quickly) corrupt wikimedia.

Maybe some of them held for a year or two, and maybe some of them worked in relative obscurity for a while and managed to keep a clean record before they gained popularity that allowed prominent politicians to cite them as a proof, and thus became a target for subversion. And maybe there are others who I didn&#x27;t know about and who have much better record (bad luck for me).<p>The underlying point is that what I observed is that once some outlet becomes widely known as arbiter of truth in any political context, and it does not have very strong independent filtering mechanism, propaganda shows up very soon. If it does have one, propaganda shows up too (e.g. there are tons of biased articles on Wikipedia and there is a lot of shoddy and biased research in scientific journals) but a bit slower.","time":1493108021,"type":"comment"}],"parent":14191480,"text":"&gt; It&#x27;s people who would not allow opinions different from their own to exist.

A helpful first step towards identifying fake news is to understand what other news organizations are saying about the topic. We believe automating this process, called Stance Detection, could serve as a useful building block in an AI-assisted fact-checking pipeline. So stage #1 of the Fake News Challenge (FNC-1) focuses on the task of Stance Detection.<p>In a nutshell, this interaction is the problem with the news cycle, and its the audience as much as its the reporting. Most people don&#x27;t click on the link.<p>---\nFrom the FAQ, lower down the page -<p>&gt; WHY DID YOU CHOOSE THE STANCE DETECTION TASK RATHER THAN THE TASK OF LABELING A CLAIM, HEADLINE OR STORY TRUE&#x2F;FALSE, WHICH SEEMS TO BE WHAT THE FAKE NEWS PROBLEM IS ALL ABOUT?<p>ANSWER:\nThere are several reasons Stance Detection makes for a good first task for the Fake News Challenge:<p>Our extensive discussions with journalists and fact checkers made it clear both how difficult “truth labeling” of claims really is, and how they’d rather have reliable semi-automated tool to help them in do their job better rather than fully-automated system whose performance will inevitably fall far short of 100% accuracy.<p>Truth labeling also poses several large technical &#x2F; logistical challenge for a contest like the FNC:<p>There exists very little labeled training data of fake vs. real news stories.\nThe data that does exist (e.g. fact checker website archives) is almost all copyright protected.\nThe data that does exist is extremely diverse and unstructured, making hard to train on.\nAny dataset containing claims with associated “truth” labels is going to be contested as biased. \nTogether these make the truth labeling task virtually impossible with existing AI &#x2F; NLP. In fact, even people have trouble distinguishing fake news from real news.<p>The dataset we are using to support the Stance Detection task for FNC-1 was created by accredited journalists, making it both high quality and credible. It is also in the public domain.\nVariants of the FNC-1 Stance Detection task have already been explored and proven feasible but far from trivial by Andreas Vlachos &amp; his students from U. of Sheffield. Cite: Ferreira &amp; Vlachos (2016) &amp; Augenstein et al. (2016).\nWe considered targeting the truth labeling task for the FNC-1, but without giving teams any labeled training data. We decided against it both because we thought a competition with a more traditionally structured Machine learning tasks would appeal to more teams, and because such an open-ended truth labeling competition was recently completed, called the Fast &amp; Furious Fact Check Challenge.\nOur discussions with human fact checkers lead us to believe that a solution to the stance detection problem could form the basis of a useful tool for real-life human fact checkers.

The twist is that you can&#x27;t compose any two functions; their input and output types have to match up. If g is A -&gt; B and f is B -&gt; C you can compose them to a function A -&gt; C, but the output type of g has to match up with the input type of f. Categories generalise this concept from composing functions to composing any thing with a notion of input and output type. In practice that often ends up being function composition anyway, but with restrictions on the function. For instance if you compose two linear functions you get a linear function, so this forms a category. Or continuous functions, or functions that can be differentiated, etcetera. However, quadratic functions do not form a category, because if you compose a quadratic function with another quadratic function you may get a function with higher degree. For instance if f(x) = x^2 then compose(f,f) is x^4. Polynomials on the other hand do form a category.

We say that a set B has the fixpoint property if any function f:B→B has a fixpoint (i.e. f b = b for some b in B).<p>With this convenient definition, we are now ready to state and prove Lawvere&#x27;s ridiculously simple and yet great theorem.<p>Theorem (Lawvere). If e:A→(A→B) is a surjective function, then B has the fixed point property.<p>The proof is quite easy. Let e:A→(A→B) be surjective. We have to show that B has the fixpoint property. That means for every f:B→B there is b∈B such that f(b)=b. Choose a function f:B→B and define the function g:A→B by setting<p><pre><code>   a ↦ f (e a a)\n</code></pre>\nAs e is surjective, there must be a0∈A such that<p><pre><code>   e a0 = g.\n</code></pre>\nBut then immediately<p><pre><code>   f (g a0) = f (e a0 a0) = g a0\n</code></pre>\nHence g a0 is a fixpoint of f&#x27;s.<p>Now many&#x2F;most paradoxa are special cases of Lawvere&#x27;s theorem. But for each paradox, the specific functions involved are a bit different. Let&#x27;s look at an example.<p>Theorem (Cantor). There is no surjection e:A→Pow(A).<p>To see why this is true, note that Pow(A) is isomorphic to A→Bool. But there is a function on Bool that has no fixpoints, for example negation ¬:Bool→Bool, contradicting Lawvere&#x27;s theorem.<p><pre><code>   ---------------\n</code></pre>\nWhat is the intuition behind Lawvere&#x27;s theorem? At first worrying about A→(A→Bool) is a bit surprising. What does that have to do with paradoxa and self-reference?<p>Well, what does it mean that A can speak about itself? To approach an answer, we could maybe first ask a simpler question: what does it mean to speak about A? How about this for an answer: to speak about A means to say something about A&#x27;s elements. What does it mean to say something about A&#x27;s elements? Maybe stating whether any given element a∈A has a property of interest? But what&#x27;s a property? Easy: a property of A&#x27;s elements is a function<p><pre><code>   p:A→Bool\n</code></pre>\nBut we don&#x27;t want just a fixed property, we want arbitrary properties. To do so,  we have to consider the function space<p><pre><code>   A→Bool\n</code></pre>\nAnd how can we turn this into self-reference? What if each element a in A  corresponded to a property over A? In other words,  (with a lot of handwaving)  self-reference means the existence of a <i>surjective</i> function<p><pre><code>   A→(A→Bool)\n</code></pre>\nThe next step is to wonder: why Bool? Why not any old set? Note that Cantor&#x27;s theorem continues to hold if we replace Bool with a larger set, but does not hold, if B in A→(A→B) has cardinality 1. What Bool and larger sets have in common is that we can <i>rearrange</i> them, i.e. there is a permuation that doesn&#x27;t have a fixpoint.","time":1493322740,"type":"comment"}],"parent":14210403,"text":"Can you explain the fixed point idea more in a beginner way?

It&#x27;s basically the abstract theory of binary associative &#x27;thingies&#x27; and &#x27;functions&#x27; that preserve these &#x27;thingies&#x27;. Most mathematicians pick it up by osmosis without really trying. That&#x27;s because they understand so well what CT abstracts from.<p>Experience has shown that without a maths background learning CT is extremely difficult. Almost everybody basically fails.<p>As somebody who taught himself CT without a math background, I suggest to expect between 100 and 300 hours of serious, intensive study before CT begins to make sense.<p>My recommendation is to bite the bullet and study one of the many good textbooks, and solve every exercise, and rote-learn the definitions until they become second nature. You will know you&#x27;ve understood CT when see why Peter Freyd&#x27;s quip\n&quot;[t]he purpose of [category theory] is to show that which is\n  trivial is trivially trivial&quot; is apt. The key concepts to learn are: category, functor, natural transformation, adjunction, universal property, limit and dualisation. Once you understand those, an extremely large number of prima facie separate mathematical concepts can be seen as instances of the same few trivial ideas. But they must be rephrased in this seemingly alien and unnatural language called CT. My favourite example is Lawvere&#x27;s unification of most known paradoxa (e.g. Cantor, Russell, Goedel, Tarski) as a basically a trivial fixpoint [1]. Note that after Lawvere had realised what most paradoxa have in common using a categorical re-formulation, it then became trivial to get the same insight without CT [2].<p>Let me illustrate the power of looking at a phenomenon using a new language with the  example of computation itself: we have two dominant abstractions of computation:<p>- Turing machines<p>- Lambda calculus<p>Simplifying only a tiny bit: Turing machines gave us the theory of computational complexity but has not been helpful at all in the development of programming languages in general, and typing systems in particular; in contrast, lambda-calculus has been the foundation of most work on programming languages in general and practically all work on types.  Yet lambda-calculus has been mostly silent on complexity theory (although [3] is the beginning of a rapprochement).<p>Finally, let me state my belief that the average programmer has currently no need to understand CT.

I&#x27;ve flagged articles on occasion before, and it can cause an instant drop of several places on the front page.

This isn&#x27;t even a good attack on YC, it&#x27;s an attack on rent-seeking and&#x2F;or the work culture of startups. YC is an effort to make startup funding more accessible, equitable, useful, and wide-ranging (or at least, that&#x27;s how it looks to me from the outside). Heck, they have RFSs that go in direct opposition to the kind of startups talked about in the article (and their interest in funding these kinds of things + moonshots are increasing, not decreasing).<p>In short - I think you&#x27;re pretty far off here, but you&#x27;re free to read into it what you want.","time":1493307930,"type":"comment"},{"by":"antisthenes","id":14213171,"parent":14212047,"text":"Now that I realize the original title was &quot;Silicon Valley: Making Life Worse for Regular People&quot;, this is a clear cut case of censorship.<p>I would hope that we&#x27;re not at 1984 level yet, so something like a title change won&#x27;t make people start engaging in SV doublethink, but you never know.","time":1493313609,"type":"comment"},{"by":"_jal","id":14212212,"parent":14212047,"text":"Agree - I saw it with the title that conveyed actual semantic content, which is why I read it.<p>So perhaps we&#x27;ll need to acknowledge this sort of editorial control a kind of signaling - a meaningless, anodyne headline means &quot;article YC doesn&#x27;t like&quot;.","time":1493306923,"type":"comment"},{"deleted":true,"id":14212208,"parent":14212047,"time":1493306897,"type":"comment"}],"parent":14211561,"text":"I&#x27;m normally not critical of mod behavior, so I don&#x27;t make this point lightly:<p>1.

Simplify the work flow to be: 1. Click &quot;new  markdown&quot; button, 2. Write some markdown. 3. Save.<p>If you defer asking the user to name a file up front, you can auto generate a filename based on the contents of the document (like parse 1st line for # My Title -&gt; my-title.md). The only sacrifice you pay is making them click &quot;save&quot; the first time; but IMO that is a lot less friction than having to name documents before I even start writing.

What does it matter when even the cheap gear comes with it anyway?<p>I&#x27;ve built a reasonable slew of ZFS backed storage (well, a 10 PB prod or so anyway, nothing compared to what some of the folks who comment here have done) and besides some hardware compat issues if you&#x27;re building storage this is currently your best option to back your objstore&#x2F;dfs.<p>ZFS as the storage backend for your DC&#x2F;Cloud? Good pick. ZFS as the &#x27;local&#x27; FS&#x27;s in your VMs? I wouldn&#x27;t bother, unless you need some features (it works pretty well with docker, as it goes, but I prefer to run apps on plain ext backed by zvols instead of &#x27;zfs-on-zfs&#x27;)....","time":1493333385,"type":"comment"}],"parent":14207024,"text":"No. ZFS is in much greater need for ECC than most other filesystems.<p>1. ZFS doesn&#x27;t come with any disk repair tools and the ones that exist are not nearly as capable as for other filesystems (the ZFS motto is that it is too costly to repair filesystems, just recover from tape instead (here we can sense the intended audience of ZFS)).

I&#x27;d argue that ZFS is a quite resource heavy filesystem and is thus more likely to actually attract bit flips. This is similar as to when using an encrypted filesystem on an overclocked CPU. There is nothing inherently more risky with encrypting your filesystem with an overclocked CPU - but overclocking your CPU increases the risk for miscalculations. And enabling encryption increases the CPU usage when accessing the filesystem by several orders of magnitude. So, in practice you quickly notice how filesystem data on encrypted drives get corrupted but not on regular drives on an ever so slightly too overclocked machine.<p>So, if you care about your filesystem, then yes - saying that ZFS needs ECC is quite sensible.\n(if you care about your data you should have backups regardless)","time":1493331188,"type":"comment"},{"by":"koffiezet","id":14211015,"kids":[{"by":"GuB-42","id":14219423,"parent":14211015,"text":"You can have disks of differing sizes with ZFS, though you are making things difficult for yourself so your point still stands.<p>However the cost of ECC is not negligible because you need your CPU and motherboard to support it.<p>The total budget for my NAS was 1000 EUR in 2013, 500 for the 5 3TB disks, 350 for the motherboard+CPU+8GB ECC RAM, and 150 for the case, PSU, system SSD, and accessories.

It is a loan, but it&#x27;s collateralized against your existing holdings. Most institutions will only loan you a percentage of your existing holdings (somewhere between 30% and 50%). Additionally, if the market value of your existing holdings dips such that the total loan amount is greater than the maximum percentage loan, those assets can (in most cases) be immediately sold to pay back the loan. This is called a &quot;margin call&quot;.<p>To use your example, if you were using margin from an institution that allows for a 50% rate, in order to get that $10k loan, you&#x27;d have to already have $20k available in a relatively liquid assets (stocks, bonds, ETFs, mutual funds). If the value of your holdings ever dipped such that you held less than $20k, thus making your loan greater than the institutions 50% limit, some of those assets would be sold to pay down the loan.<p>There are additional safety measures built into margin accounts by brokers that offer them such as ensuring that the collateral assets aren&#x27;t 100% allocated a single risk prone stock for example. Margin is a very well understood and safe business model for many brokers.<p>My understanding of the criticism of the GGP is not that Robinhood&#x27;s business model is unsafe for Robinhood, it&#x27;s that it&#x27;s unsafe for their target market (casual stock traders).

Otherwise, you&#x27;re allotted three round-trip day trades within a 5-day period before there&#x27;s serious consequences.

But what matters here isn&#x27;t the percentage, it&#x27;s the absolute number of active traders, and their analysis &quot;skill&quot;.  Let&#x27;s say you start with 50k professional bankers and 50k totally passive etf investors like you and me.  Let&#x27;s say that the passive investors buy&#x2F;sell based on events that are totally uncorrelated with the market; they buy small orders of VTI every once in a while when they have a bit of extra cash, and they sell large blocks when they experience major life events like buying a house or having a kid.  In other words, their effect on prices is random.  Also let&#x27;s assume that new passive investors are introduced into this system gradually, and that we&#x27;re taking a &quot;long term&quot; view of everything.  In this case, having another 100k, or 500k, new passive investors riding the wave of market growth doesn&#x27;t change anything.<p>On the other hand, going back to our 50k&#x2F;50k split, if you add another 100k poorly-performing analysts into the mix, e.g. uneducated consumers day-trading on emotion instead of news, they&#x27;ll distort prices and create a bit of market inefficiency.  Distorted prices are actually good for the above-average analysts, since they&#x27;ll capture those extra pennies on their trades by more-accurately pricing stocks, but obviously bad for the below-average traders themselves--who will underperform the market--and the passive investors--who just buy&#x2F;sell at market prices.  You can kind of think of this situation as the etf investors paying an additional &quot;management fee&quot; to the good traders for their trading expertise.<p>So to summarize, the percentage of passive traders to total traders doesn&#x27;t matter as long as the absolute number of active traders doesn&#x27;t decrease, which won&#x27;t happen because of the large incentives created whenever the system moves away from equilibrium.<p>---<p>Now, in practice you&#x27;ll never have <i>completely</i> passive investors.  People will panic if they lose 10% of their investments overnight.  Also, merely making a decision to invest in a particular index, like the S&amp;P 500, is making an <i>active</i> choice to invest in Apple and McDonalds but not Tesla or thousands of other companies.

Transaction costs for this are $0.10 at the brokerage.<p>Investor A wants to buy a share, B wants to sell one, on the same brokerage. Okay let&#x27;s see.<p>Brokerage does nothing (because the amount of shares they hold on the exchange for their clients doesn&#x27;t change at all). So they don&#x27;t pay anything for that either. No transaction fees, nothing.<p>A gets to buy the share, and has to pay the lowest offer + transaction costs for the share, or $4.70.<p>B wants to sell the share, and he gets to sell if for the highest bid, or $4.50, and in some cases another $0.10 in transaction costs.<p>So the brokerage &quot;captures the spread&quot;, and of course the transaction costs. In this case they made $0.40 for doing ... nothing, no share was sold or bought.<p>This is the official story. Now in practice, this means that a rather large amount of value is &quot;stored&quot; at the brokerage. It is a long accepted practice in banking that only a percentage of the stored value is kept. So while you might think that as a result of this transaction the bank&#x2F;brokerage makes $0.40 in profit, but it doesn&#x27;t. Assuming 10% reserve ratio (which is on the high end, usually either 2 or 4%). It makes (100% - 10%) * 2 * $4.55 + $0.40, and pays that out to it&#x27;s shareholders&#x2F;managers&#x2F;... (twice, because once in cash, one in a share)<p>Now you might think that&#x27;s where it stops. Well, not quite. They then go to another bank, and they say &quot;we are holding an asset worth $X on behalf of our customers, can we borrow against that ?&quot;, and the next bank say &quot;sure ! if we can do the same&quot;. So bank A gets a 2 * $4.55 debt at bank B, and bank B gets a 2 * $4.55 debt at bank A. Since this also counts as reserves, they then only keep 10% of that money actually available, and pay 90% out to their shareholders.<p>So now the bank has paid out (100% - 10%) * 6 * $4.55 + $0.40 to it&#x27;s shareholders.<p>Needless to say, keeping this whole situation stable if the market were to <i>gasp</i> drop even slightly is more than a little tricky.

Once, I went on a Boy Scout camping trip near a Civil War battlefield in the mountains along the border. After visiting the history center on the site, our scout leader told us to hike back to camp, with an older boy in the lead (while the scout leader drove back). Because the hike in had been quite long and seemed roundabout, a small subset of us decided to take a &quot;shortcut&quot; that our friend Finley insisted would get us back to camp sooner (which I guess was important because we had vital &quot;set things on fire&quot; projects to get back to).<p>We set off from the main group, and away from the well-defined trail; I don&#x27;t remember if the boy in charge objected to our innovative approach to returning to camp, or just couldn&#x27;t be bothered with it, but they went on ahead without our small adventure crew. The main group made it back to camp, as expected, about two hours later.<p>Our group, on the other hand, was still wandering through the woods as dusk approached about four hours later. Before panic set in, we luckily heard a truck off in the distance...so, we headed for it, and found a road. We assumed it was the road where the campground was located, and figured we&#x27;d be back to camp in no time (surely we were really close, given how long we&#x27;d been walking). An hour later, we saw a sign...&quot;Welcome to South Carolina&quot;. We&#x27;d walked from South Carolina into North Carolina, and were many miles from camp.<p>The scout leader found us a few hours after dark; we were on the wrong road, going the wrong way, and had likely crossed back and forth from NC to SC a couple of times in our hike. We got back to camp around 11:30PM.

This reduces pressure on the GC, since the values are just discarded along with the stack frame on return.<p>For this reason, it&#x27;s usually considered good form to pass values to functions instead of pointers, even if the values are larger. This allows the compiler to prove through escape analysis that the arguments don&#x27;t need to be heap-allocated.

Consider Java, which is also a pass-by-value language, but has &quot;reference&quot; types, except for int, float, etc. So everything is a reference except this bag of simple data types, effectively creating a 2-tiered type system.

Nil pointers are still bad because they are a value added to all pointer types by the act of taking a pointer that you can&#x27;t control, you get it whether you like it or not, <i>but</i> they are not bad in the C sense that any attempt to touch one is a segfault.[2]<p>That&#x27;s about all that matters in normal Go programming.<p>[1]: Asterisk is confusing HN&#x27;s italicization there.<p>[2]: Which is I think an important aspect of understanding the &quot;billion dollar mistake&quot;, by the way; it is easy to deconstruct that mistake as being two mistakes rolled in to one, which may perhaps explain why it was such a big mistake.","time":1493214387,"type":"comment"},{"by":"lclarkmichalek","id":14202715,"kids":[{"by":"bpp","id":14203090,"kids":[{"by":"penpapersw","id":14203331,"kids":[{"by":"int_19h","id":14208843,"parent":14203331,"text":"While QBasic didn&#x27;t have pointer types, it did have pointers in disguise (or rather, pointers without disguise, which are just memory addresses) - VARPTR, PEEK and POKE.

Consequently, there&#x27;s also no pointer arithmetic. This is sufficient to make linked lists and other similar data structures, but also makes the concept much more opaque compared to C (i.e. it&#x27;s less obvious that it&#x27;s really a numeric address).<p>On the syntax part, I think the big problem with C is that the moment you start dealing with pointers, the arcane rules for declarator precedence are in play. Pascal, OTOH, has a very regular type syntax, which in case of pointers is also easier to read - you just read ^ as &quot;pointer to&quot;, and so ^integer is &quot;pointer to integer&quot;. Same thing for dereferencing - again it&#x27;s ^, but there you read ^ as &quot;points to&quot;, and so a dereference like x^ becomes &quot;what x points to&quot;.

BSD&#x27;s kqueue EVFILT_SIGNAL event behaves precisely as you&#x27;d want in most situations: an event is triggered regardless of signal disposition. Similarly, and again unlike signalfd, an event will be triggered for each listener. This means different components of a process can react to signals without having to cooperate explicitly or implicitly, whether or not they&#x27;re using a handler or kqueue.<p>Basically all Linux needs to do is copy BSD. But that will _never_ happen, because that would be too sane.<p>There&#x27;s no way to fix the issue with coalescing. The kernel cannot buffer an unlimited number of events--memory is finite. If your process doesn&#x27;t loop on wait4 it&#x27;s fundamentally broken.<p>The pipe trick doesn&#x27;t help because you can overflow the pipe buffer, too. On a large, heavily loaded system, receiving several thousand signals before any can be processed could easily happen. In the context of a mechanism like signals where there&#x27;s no way to throttle the sender with back-pressure, coalescing is the best and correct answer.<p>The same issue pops up with inotify, which specifies the IN_Q_OVERFLOW event for the same reason. The kernel simply can&#x27;t buffer an unlimited number of events. Nor can it block file operations when the buffer is full. It can&#x27;t coalesce events, either, because they could all be from different files, and in any event I think inotify tries to preserve ordering.<p>Unsurprisingly, with EVFILT_VNODE kqueue implements file notification events only for open file descriptors. That is, you can only listen for events on files for which you have an open reference. File events are then coalesced into a buffer associated with this open reference.

Each runs for 24 hours from 17:00 on Thursday through to 17:00 on Friday when pitching&#x2F;demos start (2 minutes each) followed by prizes and food&#x2F;drinks&#x2F;party.  Any work produced belongs to the company (bear in mind this is mostly during work time) although we look at most innovative ideas for patent angles, and we get bonuses for patents that get filed as a result.  Prizes are relatively token, but prestigious.  Participation hasn&#x27;t actively had to be encouraged - most engineers who are available attend.  The main motivation for the hackathons are innovation and morale (everyone seems to enjoy them), but other benefits are education (learning new skills, languages, APIs, etc.), working with new people&#x2F;teams and personal development (e.g. it&#x27;s not unusual for new employees to take on technical lead roles that they wouldn&#x27;t have normally).<p>We also hold &quot;vacathons&quot;, which are hackathons just for the interns in the summer.
