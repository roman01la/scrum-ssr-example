If we have business logic that needs do stuff in the database, it defines an interface of some methods that it expect the database repository to implement that it can use. It then has an implementation that satisfies that interface passed to it using dependency inversion (as pointed out in the article).<p>So it really means that if some business logic related to, say, tweets needs to retrieve some from the database, it calls something like &quot;tweetRepository.findAllTweets()&quot;, which returns a bunch of &quot;Tweet&quot; domain objects. It never sees database rows, it knows nothing about which database we use, etc. Our business logic is focused <i>solely</i> on dealing with the use case, and nothing to do with the nitty gritty of how we interact with the database or how we eventually return that data to a user that needs it.<p>Which is great, because it means if we ever change how our database layer works, we only need to change our database repository code.

Even if that function is slightly long, there&#x27;s no need to split it apart just because it&#x27;s over the arbitrary threshold of say, 25 lines.<p>* Create abstractions around a set of vocabulary that you can use to describe the problem domain and the process of doing things within the application. Make sure to document your vocabulary well and try to keep it as small as possible (but not smaller)<p>A good example of this is git&#x27;s vocabulary for commits, trees, and blobs.<p>Every operation doesn&#x27;t need to be a class (or worse, a series of classes and factories).

Of course you can try to get around this with abstractions on top, as every higher-level language does, and as you can do in C++ if you&#x27;re willing to build reference-counted pointers around <i>absolutely</i> everything... but these are not <i>zero-cost</i> abstractions.<p>What Rust does is track reference lifetimes at compile time, giving you certainty about who can safely &quot;own&quot; or &quot;borrow&quot; memory in every single line of code, without any runtime pointer indirections or other slowdowns.

This is what the author of the silver searcher has claimed for a long time, but with ripgrep, it&#x27;s actually precisely the opposite. When searching a large directory of files, memory mapping them has so much overhead that reading files into intermediate fixed size buffers is actually faster. Memory maps can occasionally be faster, but only when the size of the file is large enough to overcome the overhead. A code repository has many many small files, so memory maps do worse. (N.B. My context here is Linux. This doesn&#x27;t necessarily apply to other operating systems.)<p>&gt; and relying on Rust&#x27;s regex library that compiles regexes to DFAs which can run in linear time.<p>There&#x27;s no confusion that such things can&#x27;t be done in C.

Try searching the MySQL server repository, for example, and you&#x27;ll find that the silver searcher isn&#x27;t &quot;about as fast&quot; as ripgrep. (Hint: Take a peek at its .gitignore file.[2] This has nothing to do with memory maps, SIMD or linear time regex engines.)<p>And yes, I could have done all of this in C.

In many ways this means Rust is a &quot;reasonable&quot; but not necessarily &quot;ideal&quot; fit --  we could certainly afford the overhead of a GC, so the no-GC aspect of Rust doesn&#x27;t really buy us anything major, though it does provide some nice performance and memory usage in the parts below us in the stack (Iron&#x2F;Hyper, soon Tokio). That said, the more we get into the &quot;big data&quot; and ML stuff, the more value there is in having a good C FFI and good performance profiles.<p>We get a lot of value from the other aspects of Rust though. Traits (typeclasses) are powerful and flexible. More importantly, they promote that old, but good, Java ideal of &quot;programming to interfaces&quot; without all the other baggage. Rust&#x27;s support for FP is quite good (though the lack of HKTs means there&#x27;s no monads, at least not &quot;actual&quot; monads ala the Haskell Monad typeclass). The fact that Rust closures are actually traits means you can make some really smooth interfaces that transition from just a static function to a closure and finally to a &#x27;proper&#x27; object.<p>The Macros 1.1 release recently and the Serde library hitting 1.0 have been a big deal. JSON APIs are trivial to write and get all the benefits of strong typing and Option&#x2F;Result on the deserialization side.<p>One mistake I think people make with Rust is thinking that because you <i>can</i> do things in a really efficient style, you <i>should</i>. This leads to thinking that Rust isn&#x27;t as good for &quot;applications&quot; work because you have to think about heap vs. stack allocations and lifetimes and such. But if you were going to use a GC, you can probably afford dynamic dispatch and some extra allocations anyway. Relax, clone the data&#x2F;box the trait, and come back later if the performance matters. If you wrote the thing in Python, you weren&#x27;t going to get a choice about boxing things and optimizing would be way harder anyway. Basically, if you treat Rust like an impure (and strict) Haskell or OCaml&#x2F;F#, it&#x27;ll actually work pretty well once you learn some idiosyncrasies.<p>Sorry, bit of a long tangent, but yes, like I said in the last comment, Rust asks a little more up front and in return you get better stability, correctness, and refactoring ability. Testing is easy, especially with unit testing built into the compiler flags and Cargo. Cargo really helps with the &quot;works on my machine&quot; issue and deployments.

With Go, for example, I can&#x27;t control directly whether a value lives on the stack or the heap. With Python, I can&#x27;t get assurances that variable access in loops won&#x27;t have a layer of indirection that may hurt performance. With Java, I don&#x27;t necessarily control the layout of structures in memory, which may be important for things like managing memory pages. A systems language lets me manipulate memory and machine state directly.<p>With all the power that a systems language gives, comes great risk. To err is human, and most system languages do not prevent humans from erring in ways that can cause significant undefined effects. The usual suspect is, of course, memory safety, but this can also mean things like losing sight of an algorithm because you&#x27;re carrying too much intellectual overhead when doing the aforementioned memory or system state manipulation. Computer science has lots of very well-studied approaches to solving particular parts of problems, but there&#x27;s a gap between those approaches and the expressiveness of systems languages to implement them in a way that is fault-free, or doesn&#x27;t make things like Hoare analysis too difficult to manage.<p>I am a neophyte using Rust, but it has me excited because it closes that gap in a really elegant way. I just published a libnss plugin that queries Azure Active Directory for user information[1]. Without going into too much detail, it&#x27;s a set of functions that takes pointers to memory, and stuffs them full of data that it gets from an OAuth2-protected REST endpoint. That&#x27;s a looooot of &quot;range&quot; in terms of function, and the surface area for bugs in a language like C is huge. On the other hand, doing FFI in runtime-based languages is usually very hard and can be relatively slow, which matters in something as basic as user information retrieval. Rust made writing it extraordinarily easy. I have to &quot;speak C&quot; on one end, but I can handle HTTP calls with the ease and low-risk usually only found in languages like Python. At the same time, if there is a bug that effects memory, I can trust the compiler will catch it, which frees me up to think about structure, maintainability, extensibility, &amp;c.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;outlook&#x2F;libnss-aad\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;outlook&#x2F;libnss-aad</a>","time":1493322389,"type":"comment"},{"by":"proyb2","id":14216268,"kids":[{"by":"dbaupp","id":14216463,"kids":[{"by":"proyb2","id":14218471,"parent":14216463,"text":"Good to know, indeed, the optimization wasn&#x27;t turned on, it appeared to come close to Go timing.

They&#x27;re often surprised that they can instead write that core component in Rust, without giving up any developer productivity (or sometimes gaining it, compared to hand-optimizing their code), and get something much faster than what they were able to achieve in a scripting language.<p>There was a post just the other day on the Rust reddit telling this story: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;rust&#x2F;comments&#x2F;67m4eh&#x2F;rust_day_two_a_python_devs_perspective\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;rust&#x2F;comments&#x2F;67m4eh&#x2F;rust_day_two_a...</a>, with a choice quote: &quot;I feel like I discovered a programming super power or something.

One reason that Dropbox switched to Rust from Go for one of their core components is greater control over memory footprint, which allowed them to reduce their server memory needs by 4x, leading to significant financial savings.<p>The slogan I&#x27;ve been using for Rust personally is: Confident, Productive Systems Programming.

The sometimes chose to write their sever in it too to decrease the number of languages they need to maintain in their code base, and to be able to reuse code for the backend and front end of their webapps.<p>One of the ways languages differ is how much of the hardware they abstract. Assembly is literally a list instructions to manipulate registers (a component of a processor) containing 1 number at a time, and to jump around those lines. Resisters and you memory just hold ints, so the programmer has to know what ints are numbers what are addresses pointing to an array or other number(pointer), etc. C abstracts a ton of those instructions, so for example you have to keep track of what memory you&#x27;re using but not which register has that memory&#x27;s address and how to allocate registers etc. Static typing is necessary to remember how to interpret those ints. Python abstracts even more so you don&#x27;t have to keep track of you memory and its very close to abstract logic. However, in exchange there is a large bit of code that has to run with you python code to figure out how to use the registers and assembly instructions to compute your function. OK it doesn&#x27;t do that directly, but indirectly that&#x27;s the point of what is called an interpreter.<p>There are advantages of more abstract languages like python. You don&#x27;t have to think about as much and there are generally more safety guarantees. However, sometimes you can&#x27;t afford to the time or space overhead of the interpreter. This is a commonly cited reason people move away from ruby. Sometimes you need the minute control over you data. For example, if you are writing a OS or a device driver, you need to give very specific instructions to the processor. Languages that are well suited for the latter cases are usually called systems languages.<p>Rust and Go are examples of languages that try to fit between C and Python on this spectrum. They want to give some of the abstractions and security grantees that python provides without the overhead and while enabling some precise control of the hardware if you need it. They also provide some abstractions that may speed up you code because the language designers have thought through some complex algorithms and code better than you may be able to.<p>Hope that helped, and let me know if you have any questions.","time":1493323199,"type":"comment"},{"by":"amenghra","id":14216001,"parent":14214018,"text":"Languages that bind you to a garbage collector aren&#x27;t always well suited for &quot;systems programming&quot;.

You <i>can</i> write a webserver in Python, but unless you are serving a dynamic site implemented in Python, you are likely paying a steep cost for that, at least in respect to a language with much finer control such a C&#x2F;C++ or Rust (or many others that are in this category).<p>&gt; Also how does it compare to Go?<p>My understanding of Go is that it aims to fit a <i>similar</i> niche, if not entirely overlapping.

Imagine you are telling a friend how to go pick up your drink at Starbucks, and he&#x27;s unfamiliar with the area.  You can give very general directions and trust your friend is smart enough to figure it out, and in many cases they will, after taking some time to reason out the ambiguities they are presented with in the real world.  Sometimes your drink comes back cold or wrong.  Alternatively, you can write very detailed directions for exactly where to go, what to expect to see, and what to say.  This takes time up front, but you have higher assurance that you will get your drink in a timely and correct manner.  Having a shared shorthand you and your friend know might make that list of directions a bit hard to read from the outside, but it can add to accuracy and&#x2F;or reduce the number of steps if it&#x27;s a well defined shorthand.","time":1493322311,"type":"comment"},{"by":"maxpert","id":14214685,"kids":[{"by":"Rusky","id":14214726,"kids":[{"by":"jplatte","id":14215441,"kids":[{"by":"vertex-four","id":14218356,"parent":14215441,"text":"Actually... the counterpart to the C++ new operator would be the perfectly safe `Box::into_raw(Box::new(whatever))` - along with its counterparts on other smart pointer types - and there may be a heap module one day[0] - but your point stands that this is not the &quot;default&quot; way of allocating.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doc.rust-lang.org&#x2F;alloc&#x2F;heap&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doc.rust-lang.org&#x2F;alloc&#x2F;heap&#x2F;</a>","time":1493376746,"type":"comment"}],"parent":14214726,"text":"While it is not part of the memory safety guarantee of safe Rust, in practice it is much harder to accidentally leak memory in Rust than in C++.

When I attempted to reproduce, I got the same errors on 1.2, and no errors on 1.17. Rust does <i>not</i> guarantee forward compatibility, code that compiles on 1.17 will not necessarily compile on 1.2 (of course, that would mean no new features).<p>I attempted to reproduce your report by downloading the 1.2 compiler and compiling this code in both versions. Here is what I got:<p>---<p>First, the Vec.join report. I attempted to compile a crate with this body on both versions:<p><pre><code>    fn main() {\n        let v: Vec&lt;&amp;str&gt; = vec![&quot;hello, &quot;, &quot;world&quot;];\n        v.join(&quot;&quot;);\n    }\n</code></pre>\nOn 1.2 this failed to compile with exactly the error you stated. This isn&#x27;t surprising to me since I recall us adding .join to Vec several months after the 1.2 release. So you certainly weren&#x27;t compiling that code on 1.2.<p>In contrast, on 1.17, this code compiled just fine. This is exactly what I expected, since I use vec.join all the time on vectors of string slices.<p>In conclusion, I was unable to reproduce this bug.<p>---<p>Second, the Cargo star dependencies report. Manishearth is wrong, we disallow those dependencies from being uploaded to crates.io, but end users are allowed to use them just fine (strongly recommended that you don&#x27;t, though!).<p>To attempt to reproduce, I built a crate with this dependencies section:<p><pre><code>    [dependencies]\n    chrono=&quot;*&quot;\n</code></pre>\nOn 1.2, I got exactly the error you stated. I don&#x27;t know what the source of it is, but I know that star dependencies are risky because they imply indefinite forward compatibility, which is impossible to guarantee.<p>On 1.17, this successfully resolved to the 0.3.0 version of chrono, which compiled just fine.<p>Once again, I was unable to reproduce your bug report.<p>---<p>If you have any more bug reports, please post them on <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rust-lang&#x2F;rust\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rust-lang&#x2F;rust</a> .

However, the vast majority of people wrote build = &quot;build.rs&quot;, using a build.rs file in the root of their project. This convention is now encoded into Cargo, and will be assumed if build.rs exists.<p>This is what I love about Rust&#x27;s development.  Rather than the developers just using their own ideas about how the Rust ecosystem will use a system, they instead wait for the ecosystem to come up with its own conventions.  Once those conventions are organically established, they fold them into the official Rust tools.<p>It&#x27;s the equivalent of finding product market fit.  More times than not our ideas about what the market (in this case, Rust users) wants will be wrong.  Better to just adapt to the market.<p>That&#x27;s enough praise for now, so ... how about something not so great about Rust?  I started building a password manager in Rust, because I&#x27;m not satisfied with the current options for password managers.  This will be my first Rust project with a GUI and ... so far it&#x27;s been very painful.<p>I&#x27;ve looked at GUI in Rust in the past but never tinkered because there were never any good libraries available.  It&#x27;s now Rust 1.17 and there are still no good options.  For this project I landed on gtk-rs, but it&#x27;s a nightmare of Rc&#x27;s, RefCells, and borrow_mut just to get even the simplest UI working.<p>I&#x27;m not sure yet if this is an issue endemic to gtk-rs, or if Rc&#x27;s and RefCells are a necessary evil in Rust whenever GUIs are involved.  It&#x27;s a bit hard to reason about ownership in this case, where your callbacks can be called at any time, and if they modify the UI that may trigger another, now nested callback, which may trigger yet another callback, etc.  So it requires a lot of brain power to think about every borrow and what the lifetime should be.<p>Without thinking too much about it, I feel like things could be better.  If Rust was driving the UI loop, and if the callbacks didn&#x27;t have &#x27;static lifetimes, then it might be possible shove the UI into an isolated struct and not have to deal with too many ownership and lifetime issues.  But again, I haven&#x27;t tried to think it through and it&#x27;s irrelevant because there&#x27;s no mature GUI library in Rust that would allow that.<p>Of course, none of that reflects on Rust itself, nor on the Rust developers.  This is a third-party issue; it boils down to a lack of good GUI libraries.  That&#x27;s hardly surprising given how new Rust is.<p>For now, I&#x27;m blundering forward and just hacking together whatever mess of code works.

We could bullshit our way through it. And even if you try hard, it has little to no signal. Requiring engineers to know OWASP, or to memorize organizational risk facts doesn&#x27;t work. Requiring your company to get a third party audit <i>sort of works</i>, if you know what a reputable firm actually looks like.

Clones are sometimes built with an extended barrel so they are not considered a SBR and can be treated like any normal rifle.  A common strategy is to hide the extra barrel beneath a fake non-functional suppressor [1].  Alternatively some are made as SBRs for people who are willing to get the SBR approval.<p>[0]: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;discovermilitary.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2010&#x2F;02&#x2F;mp5.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;discovermilitary.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2010&#x2F;02&#x2F;mp5.j...</a><p>[1]: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;mfiap.com&#x2F;images&#x2F;F30028878.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;mfiap.com&#x2F;images&#x2F;F30028878.jpg</a>","time":1493396261,"type":"comment"},{"by":"maxerickson","id":14220233,"parent":14219986,"text":"For a firearm purchased by mail from another state they have to be shipped to a federally licensed dealer and the transaction has all the same requirements as if you were just buying from the dealer in person.<p>There&#x27;s lots more details than that, but it isn&#x27;t a free for all.","time":1493393587,"type":"comment"},{"by":"saosebastiao","id":14220032,"parent":14219986,"text":"You can buy functional relics that are well over 30 years old if they were registered before they were banned, and you&#x27;re gonna need to be federally licensed to possess them, and you&#x27;re gonna be paying in the 5 digit range for the privilege.

The truth is both yes and no, and here is why. If we consider programming along a timeline from yesterday to today, there is unique complexity at both ends of that timeline, and unique simplicity at both ends of that timeline.<p>Today there&#x27;s extra complexity of an abundance in choice. There&#x27;s also choice in documentation, which often comes in the form of blog posts which may or may be out of date. And by the time you start to get comfortable using something the new version is probably out, which happened to me with Angular 2 (you knew Angular 4 was released right?).  So in many ways programming is more complex today. None of those kinda of problems existed when I was a kid programming on TRS-80 in the late 70&#x27;s.  There wasn&#x27;t much choice of hardware, software, or much risk of getting overwhelmed by too many learning resources.  Basically everything you could\nknow about the hardware and BIOS fit in a single book that Peter\nNorton wrote.  So yes it is more complex today.<p>But there&#x27;s complexity at the other end, too.  We used to spend a lot of time trying to cram data and operations into small amounts of memory. We spent a lot of time inventing our own serialization protocols, writing lower level communication primitives that we don&#x27;t think about today.<p>The efficiency gain is more than worth the new complexity.  A novice programmer today is able to accomplish a great deal more in a month than a novice programmer of way back when.<p>For that matter, power users of today can accomplish way more than a team of programmers could back in the day for many applications.  Much of the software I wrote in my first years as a professional developer can be done with spreadsheets.<p>The trick to keeping the efficiency is to not get lost in all the choices and remember to get real work done. Change how you do things too often and you become inefficient. Change not often enough and you become obsolete and inefficient.  The real efficiency gains come from working the same problem domain for a while with the same tools. You develop a bag of tricks for dealing with the kinds of problems you run into in that domain and you become very fast. Change too much and you don&#x27;t. But once every problem you encounter is pretty easy it&#x27;s probably time to move to a new domain.","time":1493308846,"type":"comment"},{"by":"Iv","id":14216448,"kids":[{"by":"Frenchgeek","id":14218243,"parent":14216448,"text":"10 10 moveto<p>100 200 lineto<p>No, I have no idea why I tried to learn some Postscript either.","time":1493375264,"type":"comment"}],"parent":14212250,"text":"&gt; There is a opinion I hit on every now and then—of programming, especially web development, getting ridiculously easier compared to the past.<p>Programming change.

And Swift often emits more calls than you can see (e.g. thunks, protocol witnesses, weak sentinels, etc). This is not new to Swift—the same requirement exists when passing large C values around—but we use value types a lot more in Swift for various reasons, so the issue becomes more salient.<p>In terms of remediation, I audited our app for all structs larger than a few words. I just did this manually; there were something like 120 structs to look at. For each, I converted it to a class then evaluated the impact on generated code size. Only four structs had meaningful impact on generated code size (to the tune of ~13MB), and happily, they were fully immutable, so they retained their value semantics even when converted to classes. If they had not already been fully immutable, I would have had to spend some time either adapting the classes to achieve value semantics, or adapting their clients to tolerate reference semantics.<p>Then I audited our app for all enums larger than a few words. These can be made pass-by-reference by using Swift’s `indirect` feature, which implicitly boxes associated storage. We had one enum for which this made a substantial difference, to the tune of several MB.<p>Then I had to make sure runtime performance hadn’t been too badly damaged by all the new dynamic allocations and indirections. In the end, I observed nothing noticeable. We don’t have formal repeatable performance tests, though—it would have been interesting to see the impact on those.<p>C++ has this issue, too; it largely handles it by using reference arguments when consuming large stack values. In the future, it’s possible for Swift to optimize many cases (especially intramodule) where this occurs by allowing deeper stack frames to reference values types stored in parent stack frames when it can prove it’s safe.

You use a bounded thread pool and you stay within these bounds.<p>Seeing such a speed up from simply merging text files is really puzzling to me. You have to type check the code anyway, surely the overhead of opening a new file is completely negligible compared to running this type checker on the same file? Especially since all these instances of the type checkers have to share a lot of data anyway.<p>Swift is very cool and I&#x27;m excited to see it and Kotlin become our next generation languages for mobile, front end and back end alike, but it seems to me the Swift compiler is still very immature.","time":1493263813,"type":"comment"},{"by":"jordansmithnz","id":14208291,"parent":14207752,"text":"In regards to the tool mentioned that provides information about binary size contribution...

The tourist is disappointed with\n    the fisherman&#x27;s apparently lazy attitude towards his work, so he\n    approaches the fisherman and asks him why he is lying around instead\n    of catching fish. The fisherman explains that he went fishing in the\n    morning, and the small catch would be sufficient for the next two\n    days.\n\n    The tourist tells him that if he goes out to catch fish multiple\n    times a day, he would be able to buy a motor in less than a year, a\n    second boat in less than two years, and so on. The tourist further\n    explains that one day, the fisherman could even build a small cold\n    storage plant, later a pickling factory, fly around in a helicopter,\n    build a fish restaurant, and export lobster directly to Paris\n    without a middleman.\n\n    The nonchalant fisherman asks, &quot;Then what?&quot;\n\n    The tourist enthusiastically continues, &quot;Then, without a care in the\n    world, you could sit here in the harbor, doze in the sun, and look\n    at the glorious sea.&quot;\n\n    &quot;But I&#x27;m already doing that&quot;, says the fisherman.\n\n    The enlightened tourist walks away pensively, with no trace of pity\n    for the fisherman, only a little envy.\n\n</code></pre>\n[0]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Anekdote_zur_Senkung_der_Arbeitsmoral\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Anekdote_zur_Senkung_der_Arbei...</a>","time":1493207759,"type":"comment"},{"by":"TeMPOraL","id":14202275,"kids":[{"by":"rawland","id":14202349,"parent":14202275,"text":"<p><pre><code>    The fisherman [is] not exactly helping anyone either.</code></pre>\nIn fact, he does: By leading through example.<p>And now, let&#x27;s get back to work.

Instead, he wants you to do not very well.  Then he can have an excuse to fire you.  Then he can argue that he has to pay your better replacement more, and then, since the supervisor gets paid at least 15% more than his highest paid subordinate, the supervisor gets paid more.

There commonly a middle manager wants to arrange that his position is relatively well paid and stable.  To this end he wants to build an empire of subordinates who will not challenge him.  The middle manager gets paid more because of his relatively large number of subordinates.<p>In a lot of medium to large organizations, an employee who is a <i>star</i> gets attacked.  E.g., an employee A who sells more makes the other employees look bad, and they can retaliate by sabotaging employee A.<p>E.g., in a research university, never tell the others how your research is going.  Instead, say nothing until the corresponding papers are PUBLISHED -- then it is too late for the others to sabotage the research, e.g., cause you to waste time by constantly dropping by your office to talk,  putting you on silly committees, assigning you new courses to teach where you have to do new preparations, etc.<p>Net, instead of working to make the organization more successful, it is super common to replace reality with easier to do&#x2F;defend processes and to fight with others in the company, especially just down the hall.","time":1493174553,"type":"comment"},{"by":"landmark3","id":14200859,"parent":14196731,"text":"my rule number one to be successful in a job is not to be obsessed about it","time":1493187422,"type":"comment"},{"deleted":true,"id":14201983,"parent":14196731,"time":1493203635,"type":"comment"},{"by":"sqeaky","id":14203752,"parent":14196731,"text":"&gt; To avoid colds and flus it’s important to vacuum yourself daily.

This already leads one away from several forms of &quot;pure&quot; capitalism.  Once you move away from pure capitalism though, you create new problems that require more complexity to solve (regulatory capture perhaps being one of the bigger ones).<p>* If you look at the post-industrial-revolution capitalistic societies, there is a massive underclass that was substantially made materially worse-off (yes, a generation or two later, society as a whole ends up in a generally better position, but it was accomplished by grinding up and spitting out cheap labor that typically did not directly benefit from it.<p>* There are some very serious environmental problems currently facing us, most notably global warming.  Companies\n that were profitable by externalizing the costs of these quire rationally found that the best way to maximize their profits was to muddy the scientific waters sufficiently to significantly delay any attempts at addressing these problems (which would certainly involve some way of preventing them from externalizing their costs).<p>There&#x27;s probably a lot more that I&#x27;m not thinking of right now.  I would suggest finding friends who are anti-capitalist and listening to their reasons, not with an eye to shutdown their response, but just to get a sense of differing views.<p>Even someone who agrees that the natural experiment of the 20th century proved capitalism is superior to communism (which is in itself debatable due to the low sample size and several confounding differences between the powers involved), might feel that some other non-capitalist form of economy could be superior.","time":1493182623,"type":"comment"},{"by":"rexpop","id":14200173,"kids":[{"by":"friedman23","id":14200182,"kids":[{"deleted":true,"id":14200391,"parent":14200182,"time":1493180186,"type":"comment"},{"by":"rexpop","id":14200228,"parent":14200182,"text":"If you do not grok my text, the fault lies with me.

I think this is a combination of both the fact that the lower framerate is less visual stimulation, and that I&#x27;m used to both the decreased visual stress and the overall more jittery aesthetic of 24fps.<p>Regarding &gt;24fps, I think how it&#x27;s used is critical.<p>I remember noticing <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;gallery&#x2F;2j98Y4e&#x2F;comment&#x2F;994755017&#x2F;1\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;gallery&#x2F;2j98Y4e&#x2F;comment&#x2F;994755017&#x2F;1</a> (yes, a random imgur gif - discovering that imgur doesn&#x27;t have an FPS limit was nice though). I think this particular example pushes the aesthetics ever so slightly, but still looks pretty good.<p>I don&#x27;t know where I found it but I remember watching a 48fps example clip of The Hobbit some time back. That looked <i>really</i> nice; I completely agree 48fps is a great target that still retains the almost-imperceptible jitter associated with 24fps playback.<p>To me the &quot;nope&quot;&#x2F;sad end of the spectrum is motion smoothing. I happened to notice a TV running some or other animated movie with motion smoothing on while in an electronics store a few months ago... eughhh. It made an already artificial-enough video (I think it was Monsters Inc University) look eye-numbingly fake (particularly because the algorithm couldn&#x27;t make its mind up about how much to smooth the video as it played, so some of it was jittery and some of it was butter-smooth). I honestly hope the idea doesn&#x27;t catch on; it&#x27;ll ruin kids and doom us to having to put up with utterly unrealistic games.<p>But I can see that&#x27;s the direction we&#x27;re headed in: 144Hz LCD panels are already a thing, and VR has a ton of backing behind it, so it makes a lot of sense that VR will go &gt;200Hz over (if not within) the next 5 or so years.<p>The utterly annoying thing is that raising the framerates this high almost completely removes the render latency margins devs can currently play with. Rock-steady 60fps (with few drops below ~40fps) is hard enough but manageable on reasonable settings in most games nowadays (I think?), but when everyone seriously starts pining for 144fps+ at 4K, it&#x27;s going to get a lot harder to keep the framerate consistent - now that we&#x27;ve hit ~4GHz, Moore&#x27;s law won&#x27;t allow breathing room for architectural overhead as has been the case for the past ~decade, and with current system designs (looking holistically at CPU, memory, GPU, system bus, game engine) we&#x27;re already pushing everything pretty hard to get what we have.<p>So that problem will need to be solved before 144fps+ becomes a reality. A friend who has a 144Hz LCD says that going back to 60Hz just for desktop usage is really hard because the mouse is more responsive and everything just &quot;feels&quot; faster and more fluid. I&#x27;m not quite sure whether the games he plays keep up with 144fps though :P<p>On a separate note, I&#x27;ve never been able to make the current crop of 3D games &quot;work&quot; for my brain - everyone&#x27;s pushing for more realism, more fluidity, etc etc, and it just drives things further and further into the uncanny valley for me, because realtime-rendered graphics still look <i>terribly</i> fake.

NPSS has a lot of extra information in the control inputs about pronunciation and timing (the part-of-phoneme timer feature) - this means that most of the &quot;hard parts&quot; (in my opinion) for naturalness are control inputs to NPSS&#x2F;WaveNet style models, rather than variables the model must generate globally and consistently as in lyrebird. At generation time NPSS appears to generate each component autoregressively as well, but I am not clear on whether the demo samples do this or if they use &quot;true&quot; values for f0 at least - what forces the model to sing the exact same melody, if many melodies are possible given the underlying audio information?<p>Also note that NPSS has some amount of post-processing, at least reverb and perhaps other common musical mixing - we don&#x27;t really know how these samples are generated, and I have a hard time decyphering exactly what inputs are required, and what are generated from the paper alone. However, I really, really, really like NPSS - I just don&#x27;t think the comparison you are making is valid here.<p>These features (f0, duration, pronunciation) are some of the most difficult things to learn to model from datasets of speech and text directly, and I am not sure how they got the subset used (I think only f0 and pronunciation&#x2F;phoneme) for this NPSS model. Giving creators fine-grained control of the performance (as in NPSS) is quite cool, and if these systems can get fast enough I think the possibilities are really exciting. The same things could likely be done with lyrebird as well - there is no real &quot;tech reason&quot; you couldn&#x27;t add more conditional inputs, with finer grained information&#x2F;control.<p>The key part in my mind is deciding what amount of complexity to show to a user, and what amount to try and capture inside the model - some people may want to control (for example) duration and f0 directly for a performance, while others may want to just upload clips to an API and get reasonable results back, with less ability to control each sample (they can still curate themselves for the &quot;best&quot; samples). Lyrebird.ai is handling the latter case, while the former case would require quite a bit more intervention from the average user, almost becoming like an instrument ala the original voder [0]. However, you could potentially have <i>both</i> approaches as a kind of beginner&#x2F;advanced mode, but advanced mode needs a user interface, and probably near-realtime feedback.<p>I used to really strongly believe that the audio model was going to be the hard part of &quot;neural&quot; TTS (blame my background in DSP perhaps), but post-WaveNet the game has really changed a lot - conditional audio models are something we are starting to know how to do pretty well.<p>The text pipeline of most TTS systems is still the craziest part in my mind, check out a &quot;normal&quot; feature extraction of 416 hand-specified features [1]! These extractions can be upwards of 1k features per timestep&#x2F;frame, and generally require a lot of linguistic knowledge to specify for new languages.

Previous work from Jose Sotelo et. al. (including me) called char2wav [2] is a close neighbor to Graves&#x27; approach, though he (Graves) never published the approach for speech so we don&#x27;t really know. Google&#x27;s recent Tacotron paper [3] is also a relative to these approaches.<p>WaveNet certainly changed the game in many ways, but approaches to TTS using RNNs have different roots. WaveNet and friends (incl. DeepVoice and NPSS linked elsewhere in this thread) are largely focused on audio modeling, and generally use something closely related to the &quot;classic&quot; TTS pipeline for text in the frontend. The audio modeling results are stellar, and really blew me away personally - basically changing my perspective on what is possible in audio modeling overnight.<p>RNN models try to tackle the whole problem (text + audio modeling) at once, though currently (all?) RNN and attention style models need intermediate &#x2F; high level hints or pretraining from things like vocoder representations or spectrograms, versus WaveNet&#x27;s approach using the waveform directly. So they are complimentary in many ways, and I am sure we will see people trying to combine them soon - char2wav has this flavor by using SampleRNN, our lab&#x27;s take on raw waveform generation though we are still working on the fully end-to-end from scratch training, the inference path is truly end-to-end. Though there are still many details to work out as far as output quality, it seems possible that this will be a productive approach (though I am quite biased).<p>We see similar directions in neural machine translation (NMT) moving from word level representations to word parts or characters directly - one of the big reasons deep learning has come so far, so fast is that a lot of techniques from other subfields can be utilized for new domains, and I think there is a lot more fertile ground for crossover in both directions.<p>Heiga Zen has a great overview talk about how speech synthesis, as a field, overlaps between different approaches and factorizations [4].
