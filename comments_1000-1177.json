The USA and SV aren&#x27;t going anywhere, they will still be here in another year or so (at least, i&#x27;d like to think so) when you are past the helter-skelter startup days, and will be in a position to create some more breathing room.

Before my student visa expired I put together an E-2 application that ultimately got denied. It&#x27;s a complex visa that requires a lot of documentation, so highly recommend you get an experienced immigration lawyer who can guide you through the process, understands the business side of things and can help you avoid any pitfalls. Some things to consider for the E-2 from my experience:<p>- You need to own &gt;50% of the company at the time of application or if you have co-founders from the same country, collectively you need to own &gt;50%.<p>- You do need to invest your own money in the company - there isn&#x27;t a defined amount but your company needs to have a plausible path to financial sustainability, generating profits and ideally hiring US workers. Like you say, IP can count toward this investment. I invested my savings in the company, but they weren&#x27;t convinced it was irrevocably committed because most of it hadn&#x27;t been spent (!)<p>- If you&#x27;re investing money, make sure you show where the money came from and how it was earned (in my case, some was gifted by family through inheritance and it got super messy especially as we hadn&#x27;t been clear from the outset)<p>- The E-2 is time limited and doesn&#x27;t have a path to residence - meaning it is either issued for a 2 or 5 year period and has to be renewed. At renewal you&#x27;ll need to show that your company is still going strong, otherwise it could be denied. You&#x27;ll need to find other options for a Green Card &#x2F; Citizenship.<p>- You can apply in your home country or in the US as a change of status. Better to apply in your country as this gives you a physical visa that allows you to come and go. If you only have a change of status, if you leave you&#x27;ll have to apply for the E-2 in your home country all over again.<p>- US Embassies in different countries have slightly different approaches around the E-2 or requirements in how the documents are filed. Take a close look at their website and ideally get a lawyer who is familiar with the embassy that you intend to apply through.<p>Get some good advice, most lawyers will give you a short initial consultation for free. Avvo.com was a life-saver. Peter Roberts who advises a lot of YC companies is also highly recommended.<p>Thankfully my wife ended up getting us green cards through her own employment... I think there&#x27;s some truth to the other comment about not moving.

But I think it&#x27;s dead anyway.<p>The problem devops intended to solve was the lack of proper communication and mutual understanding between developers and systems administrators. It has failed to solve this problem and, by the current definition, is getting farther and farther away from doing so.<p>Two main reasons contribute to this conclusion:<p>1. For startups, trying to make due with the least number of people possible, the term has been taken to mean you need no systems administrators whatsoever. This is no different than startups have always done - have developers do everything - but now it&#x27;s disguised as a good practice.<p>2. Developers and system administrators have different goals. These need not be opposing, but having people wearing two hats means sacrificing one goal for the other. Usually, reliability and long term maintainability suffers as developers (as a profession) are much more vulnerable to hype.<p>Where startups are concerned, this may be irrelevant, as most go bust before this becomes a (culture) problem.<p>But for established organizations, this can lead to disaster. Every organization needs people that <i>care</i> about staying ahead of the curve and people that <i>care</i> about keeping the service at its highest levels of reliability (=quality). Both kinds of people must participate in the process from the start, as peers, and keep each other in check. This is (should be) devops.<p>PS: In the corporate scene devops is also dead, but because it now means &quot;systems administrator&quot; with no change in mentality, just to be cool.","time":1493042932,"type":"comment"},{"by":"d--b","id":14183958,"parent":14183121,"text":"DevOps is the realization that the running of a software platform is a complex task, and so:<p>1.

Engineers should be onboard in the day to day monitoring of the platform.<p>It shouldn&#x27;t come as a big surprise because it is something that is well understood in other engineering disciplines, but somehow in IT, the development team can be fairly remote to actual operations. For instance, when you outsource the design &#x2F; construction of an application, it doesn&#x27;t usually come with running the actual thing, or even the necessary training for supporting the application.","time":1493039167,"type":"comment"},{"by":"geofft","id":14184330,"parent":14183121,"text":"First, &quot;the DevOps profession&quot; is one of two major uses of the term &quot;DevOps,&quot; and, in my opinion, an erroneous one. But words are defined by how they&#x27;re used, so we have to deal with this.<p>You can see &quot;DevOps&quot; as a mindset, that developers should understand how to operationalize their code and ops staff should understand how to write and debug the code they&#x27;re maintaining. That is the original idea: there used to be a lot of resistance to the idea that devs should care about deployment or that ops folks should be expected to program.<p>You can also see &quot;DevOps&quot; as a role, meaning sysadmins who know how to code. That&#x27;s largely becoming less of a role, I hope, due to some combination of <i>all</i> sysadmins being expected to code (except in non-best-practices environments like large banks or small startups with opinionated people), and &quot;DevOps&quot; in the previous sense becoming more successful. AWS is certainly part of it, because it makes it more possible for someone with a developer skillset to deploy a working app, but devs have been pinch-hitting as ops for decades and it hasn&#x27;t killed the ops profession.<p>That said, knowing software engineering doesn&#x27;t imply a knowledge of AWS, and it certainly doesn&#x27;t imply a knowledge of how to evaluate tradeoffs in AWS - should you make the code more complex to span AZs? Should you deploy cool software on EC2 boxes or use AWS&#x27;s managed infrastructure? Should you store certain data in S3 or in a normal filesystem? If it&#x27;s in S3, should you make it directly accessible or proxy it through your app? etc. That will continue to be a skillset, and there will always be times when &quot;install normal software in EC2&quot; will be the right answer and therefore necessitate the entire old-school ops skillset. And for many industries, there will also be times when &quot;actually, don&#x27;t put this in the cloud&quot; is the right answer, too. So from that perspective, I would certainly not say that AWS is killing the ops profession, whether you call it &quot;ops&quot; or &quot;DevOps&quot;.

I built something similar a while ago to warp time in video games (for training reinforcement learning agents).<p>Some issues off the top of my head (that I ran into):\nVDSO censoring is a lot harder than just symbol overriding, it has to actually be removed from the aux vector (third thing on the process stack when the process launches after arguments and environment variables.  The EHDR entry is what you need to remove.<p>Gist for censoring EHDR: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;machinaut&#x2F;a08b581c921775263cf0e20ccc974cbd\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;machinaut&#x2F;a08b581c921775263cf0e20ccc...</a><p>Some libc&#x27;s (notably glibc) are really good at finding&#x2F;using EHDR even if you do that symbol overriding, so dumping EHDR is the most assured way of making sure it&#x27;s gone.<p>ptrace overhead is HUGE -- because you&#x27;re debugging a userspace program with another program every time call now results in 4 context switches (to&#x2F;from your debugging program at every time call entry&#x2F;exit), even pinning both to the same CPU this is not fast.<p>This is where my least favorite part of the linux kernel comes in handy: SECCOMP-BPF.  Instead of firing _every_ syscall, you can write a syscall packet filter rules list that only matches certain time-based syscalls with certain arguments.  This greatly improves the performance (but for me, still not fast enough to play video games live).<p>At the end of the day I ended up reviving a &gt;10 year old patch someone sent to the linux kernel to add these parameters (time offset and time warp) to thread structs and do the warping in the kernel (much faster -- dont pay the context overhead, etc).  Sadly even this didn&#x27;t work because our end application needed to run on multiple clouds in docker, and we&#x27;d need to have access to the host kernel to do these operations.<p>I&#x27;d like to have an affine time warp as part of the cgroups, and then maybe extend it through runc so anyone can run time-warped docker containers, but maybe that&#x27;s wishful thinking.<p>Overall I think this is great work, and super happy you posted it.

Researchers are often unable to demonstrate or\nevaluate new techniques beyond small toy applications, and\npractitioners are often unable to adopt methods from the\nliterature in new and existing applications. This position\nstatement examines a vision in which anybody can modify\nany GUI of any application, similar to a scenario where\nevery GUI of every application is open-source. We are\ncurrently working to enable this vision through our\ndevelopment of Prefab, using pixel-based interpretation of\nGUIs to enable modification of those GUIs without any\ncooperation from the underlying application. We see\nparticipation in the FLOSS HCI workshop as valuable in at\nleast two regards. First, fully realizing this vision will likely\nrequire a community-based approach, so we are interested\nin Prefab as a platform for collaboration between HCI\nresearchers and the FLOSS community. Second, enabling\narbitrary modification of any GUI would seem to blur many\ncurrent distinctions between open and closed applications,\nintroducing new research questions and further magnifying\nthe importance of the workshop’s focus.&quot;<p>&quot;Content and Hierarchy in Pixel-Based Methods for Reverse-Engineering Interface Structure&quot; at CHI2011: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;homes.cs.washington.edu&#x2F;~jfogarty&#x2F;publications&#x2F;chi2011.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;homes.cs.washington.edu&#x2F;~jfogarty&#x2F;publications&#x2F;chi201...</a><p>&quot;A General-Purpose Target-Aware Pointing Enhancement Using Pixel-Level Analysis of Graphical Interfaces&quot; at CHI2012: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;homes.cs.washington.edu&#x2F;~jfogarty&#x2F;publications&#x2F;chi2012-prefab.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;homes.cs.washington.edu&#x2F;~jfogarty&#x2F;publications&#x2F;chi20...</a><p>And if you&#x27;re into the history of window management, and would like to read some interesting discussions about many great ideas, check out this classic Springer Verlag book that&#x27;s now available free online:<p>&quot;Methodology of Window Management&quot;: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.chilton-computing.org.uk&#x2F;inf&#x2F;literature&#x2F;books&#x2F;wm&#x2F;overview.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.chilton-computing.org.uk&#x2F;inf&#x2F;literature&#x2F;books&#x2F;wm&#x2F;...</a><p>By F R A Hopgood, D A Duce, E V C Fielding, K Robinson, A S Williams. 29 April 1985.\nThis is the Proceedings of the Alvey Workshop at Cosener&#x27;s House, Abingdon that took place from 29 April 1985 until 1 May 1985.

The companies themselves will often try to recruit you.<p>Machine learning is, like a lot of software engineering, easy to pick up and play with over a weekend, yes. But it is more difficult to become competitively competent right now for two reasons: 1) the field is exploding with incoming talent looking to capitalize on the new AI wave and 2) the amount of research you&#x27;ll want to keep up with to stay informed is much higher than infosec.<p>To be fair though, I still believe someone can pick up machine learning.

Generalizing -- Cyber security interfaces significantly with people and process across the whole of an organization, so tends to require more face time.<p>2. It&#x27;s easier to experiment and learn ML on your own. Grab a project, come up with some ideas and then get them up on Github. That&#x27;s much hard to do in the security realm.<p>If I were you, I&#x27;d see if you can carve out some time for a passion project. Pick up a ML framework and see what you can do.

This sounds like my oldest child, until we figured out how to get him adequate accommodation. A child who is both gifted and has challenges is often enormously frustrated. They tend to go for the only thing that works to get them some relief from the boredom of a bright mind trapped behind barriers and treated like they are dumb.<p>I also will recommend that instead of trying to find him a non-language outlet that you focus on helping him overcome his receptive and expressive disorders enough to adequately connect with the world around him. This was the approach I took.<p>I addressed individual pieces of the puzzle. I got him to learn to talk through things. I taught grammar, vocabulary, typing, and all the different pieces of how to write separately. We homeschooled for a long time and the first five years, he was incredibly resistant to writing anything. I did as much as possible without requiring him to actually write (other than working some on his handwriting). Then he discovered FanFiction.net and wrote several thousand words the first few days.<p>It is important for the child to be interested. That is the motive. But a 2xe child also needs help overcoming a lot of different barriers.<p>I have sympathy for what you want to do here and why, but I think you have a lot different things backwards.<p>My son has a tremendous interest in video games. He blogs about it and he has taken up modding games, but it has taken a long time to get here. I know a little html and css and I was able to explain coding to him in a way that made sense to him. He already knew a little html because of some forum he participated in. When they changed what was available, he kept using the font colors and other effects he liked because he had memorized the code. He didn&#x27;t yet understand that was &quot;coding.&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t remember the discussion he and I had about all that, but I do remember it was a big deal to him.<p>There are lots of things that can help kids like this. You haven&#x27;t really given the kind of information that would allow me to tell you specific things you could try. But, generally, you want to try to help him overcome his weaknesses enough such that they don&#x27;t prevent him from doing what he wants, help him finds ways to get around things he just can&#x27;t do (because they often aren&#x27;t actually pertinent anyway) and support his interests.<p>I found it really helpful to do personality profiles and learn about learning styles. Instead of treating my son as a handicapped child who couldn&#x27;t do &quot;normal&quot; things, I treated him as an interesting, quirky kid who needed a custom fit approach. I think this generally works better and gets better results. I also think it is a more accurate concept for people who are different.<p>If you haven&#x27;t heard of Temple Grandin, I suggest you google her and start reading books and articles by&#x2F;about her.

All words (I think) of memory had tags to specify if the memory was initialized (maintained by the VM) stack&#x2F;heap (maintained theoretically by the C runtime) or code&#x2F;data. The goal was to make a C machine that was maximally friendly for education.<p>Here&#x27;s a C REPL that compiles to that assembly and runs it on the VM: \n<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;csclub.uwaterloo.ca&#x2F;~j3parker&#x2F;things&#x2F;evalc&#x2F;evalc&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;csclub.uwaterloo.ca&#x2F;~j3parker&#x2F;things&#x2F;evalc&#x2F;evalc&#x2F;</a> it compiles on keyup (I had vague goals of very quick feedback) and there is a line-edit below the source code that you can put C expressions into (e.g. type &quot;fib(12)&quot; without the quotes and hit enter - it should print 233 if you haven&#x27;t modified the code.)<p>The parser is mostly-complete C99 (typedefs were an issue - the first parser used a YACC-like generator which is known to have troubles here - the next version used a hand-rolled recursive descent parser. That one didn&#x27;t get finished but also had way better error messages, as expected.) The compiler (semantic analysis + codegen) didn&#x27;t support much of the language though, e.g. it doesn&#x27;t know how to code-gen for &gt; but it knows &lt;. So, the compiler is not at a very usable state.<p>I also had a V2 of the VM with an insane fixed 8-bit instruction set (with 200+ instructions) for a stack-based (not register) machine with a 32 bit address space.

I&#x27;d be <i>highly</i> interested in a series or even very short writeup about how you made the ui and it&#x27;s various components with JUCE.

I read Physics at university the first time round, which was short on computing lectures as you might expect, so my introduction to order notation was formal and mathematical; the last time someone asked me about it in an interview, they got diagrams, graphs, ranges of applicability, definitions, examples, a short diatribe about how using the symbol &#x27;=&#x27; was really unhelpful, the whole lot. Seemed to go well; when we got to the section on his &quot;things to ask about&quot; sheet marked &quot;communication skills&quot; he just put a tick in the box and said we could skip over it, so one unexpected benefit of maths as a hobby has been to force my own mathematical thinking into rigour, with a knock-on effect in technical communication.<p>How it works for me is probably not how it would work for everyone, and I learned it the hard way; grind. Hour after hour, evening after evening, weekend after weekend of just sitting at the table with the book, some pencils and pads of paper. Each time I&#x27;d be done for the day, I&#x27;d pick up and recycle the drifts of paper that had collected on the floor as I&#x27;d discarded each piece I didn&#x27;t need anymore. It gets in you, sometimes. I&#x27;d sit down at lunchtime with a sandwich, thinking I&#x27;d just look at the next question to get a feel for it, and get up again six hours later having thrashed it to death, picked it apart, textbooks I didn&#x27;t even remember fetching from the shelf open on the desk, and pages and pages around my feet containing my own handwriting that I also didn&#x27;t remember writing. Each time I found something I just couldn&#x27;t grasp, couldn&#x27;t understand, I&#x27;d just push on. Sometimes I&#x27;d never get it, sometimes I&#x27;d come back to it twenty pages later and it would seem simple (and sometimes I&#x27;d rage at how poorly the author had explained it, which was probably fifty percent the thrashing of my dying ego).<p>I have genuinely described as &quot;black magic&quot; taking a converging infinite series, and by adding zero to it, making it converge faster. So much faster.","time":1493461344,"type":"comment"}],"id":14224446,"score":47,"by":"examcoffee","text":"How is your experience? Interests?

Ever since &quot;Web 2.0&quot; was a thing, we&#x27;ve been trying to fit this round peg of delivering complex apps into the square hole of the web browser.  Sometimes, we do a decent job.

I suspect that this would be true for half of Silicon Valley.

Everyone has their own good parts and pain points to be addressed, and all these tools were built with the best of intentions, to solve specific classes of tough problems, which may happen to be yours.  Look at the success and failure stories, and see who&#x27;s happy with their decisions about their tools, and which problems were solved with what framework.<p>3) For those people telling you &quot;just use vanilla JS&quot;, I&#x27;ll leave you this:\nAny sufficiently complicated vanilla JS program contains an ad-hoc, informally-specified, bug-ridden, slow implementation of half of Angular or React.","time":1493520195,"type":"comment"},{"by":"daleholborow","id":14218302,"parent":14218177,"text":"<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;aurelia.io&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;aurelia.io&#x2F;</a><p>I am a backend guy with some experience in Angular 1.5, Backbone etc, but currently dabbling in the front end again, and Aurelia looks pretty cool.

Neither React nor Angular will fix this for you. You&#x27;re going to have to work with all existing browsers and their issues (which are quite a lot, especially when you want to go little &#x27;deeper down&#x27;).  \n- On styling CSS: Either use a framework like Bootstrap or Material Design Lite, or try to use a pre-processor like SASS. LESS and Stylus, also 2 pre-processors, are losing a bit on popularity, or so it seems. SASS is a good &#x27;safe bet&#x27;. There&#x27;s lots of documentation and fairly decent frameworks were made around it.<p>- React and Angular are both really good, have amazing documentation and tutorials. But for me personally, React translates really well my experience from Flash&#x2F;Flex. Angular is also a very nice framework of course, but it feels to me like it is still more something I would use to make webSITES in, instead of webAPPS (although I&#x27;m building a huge app in it right now), since it is not as &#x27;fast&#x27; and &#x27;snappy&#x27; to create components and an architecture as it is with React. (I&#x27;m talking development wise, not performance)<p>- On dependencies: I really dislike the entire dependency hell I always end up in when starting a JavaScript project. Since both JavaScript and TypeScript use NPM (at least, that&#x27;s the current de-facto standard), TypeScript does not solve this for you. \nFor instance: how do you manage your dependencies? NPM, Nuget or Yarn? What&#x27;s the difference, and do you have a day to look it all up?\nHow are you building your project and your .sass files? Gulp, Grunt, Webpack, NPM scripts, or just vanilla commandline?\nIf you&#x27;re creating a new class, how are you going import it in your consumer class? Declare all external JS files in your index.html? Or maybe you prefer CommonJS, RequireJS, UMD, SystemJS or ES2015(=ES6) native modules? And what if one dependency uses another system than you do?<p>- On languages:<p>TYPESCRIPT: it&#x27;s a very nice and powerful language, but like I said, it hooks into the standard JavaScript ecosystem. On top of the dependency hell, you&#x27;ll have to use a lot of JS interops (to be able to use existing JS libraries), which aren&#x27;t always that well maintained.<p>ES6: You could use the ES6 version of JavaScript. You&#x27;ll need Babel to transpile to ES5 JavaScript, so your code will run in all browsers. No problems with JS interops here, but dependency hell and ecosystem problems will stay.<p>GOOGLE DART: Also an amazing language, written by Google. You can discuss on what&#x27;s the better language (TypeScript or Dart), but the advantage here is the ecosystem. You build with Pub, you manage your dependencies with Pub, and there&#x27;s only one way of importing external classes. A lot of modern API&#x27;s you&#x27;ll need, like Futures (kind of like Promises), and Streams (like Observables) are built in the language itself, meaning they are maintained and tested by Google. I&#x27;ve been using AngularDart (a Dart-based Angular) for over 6 months now, and it&#x27;s going really well.<p>So for me, this results in:<p>- JavaScript ES6:\n  + Simple and fun language\n  + Close to old-skool JavaScript\n  - Too limited in OOP features\n  - Inconsistent and way too fast changing JavaScript ecosystem (dependency management, build tools, importing external libraries, ..)<p>- TypeScript:\n  + Very nice language\n  + Projects like Angular and React are written in it, so it&#x27;s easy to find tutorials in TypeScript\n  + Popular, and well documented\n  - Inconsistent and way too fast changing JavaScript ecosystem (dependency management, build tools, importing external libraries, ..)\n  - Had a lot of bullshit with JS interops (Both with finding good interops for JS libraries, as with creating interops myself)<p>- Google Dart:\n  + Very nice language (very close to Java and C#)\n  + AngularDart is fun to work with\n  + Very consistent eco-system\n  + Really well documented\n  + Good support from Google and community members on Gitter chat\n  + The most common API&#x27;s you&#x27;ll need are either included in the SDK, or written and maintained by Google themselves.\n  - Third-party libraries are not always that well documented\n  - The community is not (yet?) as big as the TS or JS community, so obviously it&#x27;s a little bit harder to find code examples etc<p>Conclusion:<p>- React is awesome, but being dependent on TypeScript (or ES6), you&#x27;ll spend lots and lots of time on managing your dependencies when your project grows even the slightest bit<p>- Google Dart is awesome, but AngularDart, although it&#x27;s a lovely piece of software, is still no React.<p>But for now I choose AngularDart. Perhaps in the future I&#x27;ll choose for React+TS again. But I&#x27;ll continue hoping for a real ReactDart. :)","time":1493383171,"type":"comment"},{"by":"loftsy","id":14218481,"parent":14218177,"text":"Dart is a sane language with great tooling.

Some people will say you should use a &quot;boilerplate&quot; to learn React, and they&#x27;re wrong - boilerplate projects almost always come with too many pieces configured, and are confusing for beginners.<p>Instead, the best advice is to focus on learning React itself first.

I like this tool a lot. It&#x27;s simple, responsive, fast, and covers nearly all the relevant data points without any obfuscating clutter.<p>There are a couple items we look for that might be worth including in the CSV exports, depending on what kind of scale you want to plan for. Specifically:<p><pre><code>  1. Project name,\n  2. Project ID or number, \n  3. Employee name, \n  4. Employee ID or number, \n  5. Employee email, \n  6. Supervisor name, \n  7. Supervisor employee ID or number, \n  8. Supervisor email, \n  9. Task or activity code, and \n  10. Task or activity description. \n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s important for us to be able to line up time tracking data to W2 data from a payroll system, which is frequently hosted separately with different data standards. So employee numbers (not SSNs obviously) really help when dealing with larger companies where a significant number of employee names may change (e.g. due to marriage) or may be formatted with slight variations (e.g. nicknames instead of full legal), or where the odds of a name collision are high. We also like to see departments, cost centers, legal entities, locations, lines of business, etc. where applicable, but we can usually layer those on from other data sources if we can join on a unique identifier, whether it&#x27;s at the project, task, or employee level.<p>If I can get that data in a single CSV export for all employees at a company, I&#x27;m like 70% done with the calculation.<p>And while this sounds like an odd use case, pretty much any profitable company doing software development in the US should be claiming the credit (and actually in pretty much any developed country, because most have a credit that was modeled on the US&#x27;s). Even smaller shops with only a handful of employees usually see substantial benefit. Having the data formatted like this up front reduces the costs of doing an R&amp;D credit study and dramatically reduces the odds of an adverse adjustment in exam or audit. Especially when the employees have been diligent about recording their time and the associated activity&#x2F;project&#x2F;task data. It&#x27;s also worth noting that this is one area of the tax code that does not seem likely to be affected by tax reform as both the Ryan and Trump plans propose to leave the credit as it is.<p>Edit: oh and I forgot because this doesn&#x27;t relate to my work, but having an option for charge codes is nice.

Ended up setting one up in Bath, that ran for a bit and started attending the local cycle campaigning group. A respect ride held in honour of a young man that was killed in a hit and run however became something bigger than a Friday night protest ride, and I was the main speaker at a large ride held in his honour. It was rather humbling.<p>After that I was asked to be chair of Cycle Bath and over the last 3 years I’ve taught myself about transport, helped the council win millions in funding, and made cycling a key agenda item locally. I’ve learnt a lot about social media, public engagement and how to work with councils.<p>My proudest moment was cycling along a towpath I’d fought hard to have upgraded to a 4 season wheel friendly surface, even having police protection at a meeting, and seeing people in wheelchairs using it. It brought home that much of the cycle advocacy is just about making public space easier for people, particularly kids and people with mobility issues, to get around independently.<p>Recently I created a transport tube map for Bath and this resulted in a national series of workshops teaching people how to make this key campaigning tool for cycle advocacy groups and even some council officers.<p>I’ve begun to apply my IT skills to analyse UK Census 2011 commuter flow data and model modal split flows within the city. This piece of work might go national in the next couple of weeks due to some of the analysis I’ve been able to do. (Cycling and Walking can be hugely under-represented in the stats that councils use for transport planning.)<p>I’m now thinking of running for council in 2019 and hopefully getting the transport brief. It’s considered a bit of a poison chalice but personally I cannot see a better way to help improve the city which has been my home for the last 16 years.<p>If somebody had told me in 2010, that that one cycle ride home would have lead to this, I simply would not have believed them.

They come and go (out of fashion) but one idea stuck around for more than five years. It&#x27;s an edtech for children, so by the end of last year, I decided that maybe I should take the plunge. Plus I was getting bored of freelancing for corporations. First step is to find out whether I actually <i>like</i> to work with children - because I think that&#x27;s important even though it&#x27;s edtech - and whether the assumptions I made were sensible enough. My dream is to make reading (English) as universal and enjoyable as possible, particularly for disadvantaged children.<p>So off I went to South East Asia. I volunteered at a semi-Montessori school for poor and refugee kids for three months. To talk about the experience will take much more than a single post, but let me just say that without it, I would still be feeling that I&#x27;m so clever of thinking about this idea when I was actually faffing about. The reality of poverty and hardship came down like a ton of bricks. I saw clearly the barriers that the children had, for just being born in the wrong place at the wrong time. And the usefulness of books and the Internet stuck out like ... they&#x27;re essential, they&#x27;re the only fair chance these kids can ever get. (One thing I also learnt is that mobile phones are practically universal, poor or not.)<p>So that made the idea all the more urgent. And another thing that I never expected to pick up was that I gained a lot more confidence - I&#x27;m the shy type who would shake and get sick just thinking about presenting in front of my team - but in those classrooms, man, it&#x27;s merciless, and plus you love those kids and have the ultimate responsibility to manage them ...<p>I wouldn&#x27;t say that this fully prepared me for the CEO job but it&#x27;s definitely a strong stepping stone for me :) And those memories really stay with you forever. So if anyone&#x27;s thinking about volunteering - because this feeling doesn&#x27;t occur but in specific times - I highly recommend you to go for it.

Example: on a house fire, if a crew go in on an attack line to do interior attack, and nobody does a 360° sizeup, you may miss the 500 gallon propane tank next to the back wall, which is being impinged on by fire.

The one I remember most is probably one where the son had some sort of progressive genetic condition where when he was young he was fine, but over the years he was losing more and more functionality (speech regression, physical control regression) he was in the mid-late stages of the disease when I was there and you could see his father remembering how he was earlier, and trying to cherish the current state of his son, while knowing what was to come and that he was going to lose him.<p>I think everybody who talks about &quot;pulling oneself up by their bootstraps&quot; and &quot;anybody can do it via hard work&quot; would benefit from seeing that unfortunately we are not all born equal, and that you can work as hard as you want but if you&#x27;re not lucky enough to be born with the right body, in the right place at the right time, it won&#x27;t mean much. I remember there was a friend of a friend that came by sometimes, he didn&#x27;t have a mental impairment at all (he was super super sharp, and wrote amazingly well, I think he was actually published) but he had little control over his body (stuck in a wheelchair, drooling, could not talk at all) and was able to communicate via a jury-rigged typewriter since he was able to more or less move one hand. He definitely understood very well what was going on and his predicament, but he was still able to make something of himself and (mostly) have a positive attitude.<p>When I see all the sports people that say &quot;I succeeded because I wanted it more than my competitors and I worked super hard for it&quot;, it makes me think that quite a few of the people I volunteered with worked super hard to run with significant impairments that made their gaits anything but normal, and week after week they would train to get better, but obviously they would never win a marathon or anything. Every elite athlete when asked first thing should say &quot;I am so extremely lucky to have been born with my genetics, I worked hard, yes, but so does everybody else&quot;<p>And dovetailing on what I was saying above: I also was shown time and time again that just because two people have the same disability, it doesn&#x27;t mean they are the same, or that they want the same things, or that they need the same things, a significant disability sometimes makes you not see the rest of the person, but they are still there.<p>It definitely was a very important experience in my life, and definitely very recommended for everybody.

Want to see something happen?  Go do it, or better yet, learn to do it with others. You generally don&#x27;t need permission to start your own thing and make a difference if you don&#x27;t see something happening.<p>LEARN TO ALWAYS ADD VALUE, FIRST: Volunteering taught me to add value first, unconditionally.  Volunteering is a habit that can be practiced to the point of it being second nature, and that&#x27;s when it gets really special.<p>ORGANIC NETWORK DEPTH: Through adding value always, a side effect, volunteering gradually grew my network through similarly practicing people who over time think of you as you think of them.  I genuinely have an interest in people and curious enough that I can be sincere about giving a shit about others.<p>Most people think of networking as primarily a professional thing. Networking helps you volunteer much better too, when you have a track record of getting things done and successes under your belt with a group of people - if need arises, a group of you can move into the realm of community organizing and not just volunteering.<p>COMMUNITY ORGANIZING: When you learn to work with people that can&#x27;t always work with others - this is a highly transferrable skill.  Beyond this, creating approachable opportunities for others to volunteer who can only see their time as x hours a month is very powerful, if you find this something you want to do.  Direct and transferrable parallels to startup growth.<p>LOOKING BACK (and forward).. you get a track record.  You know you can learn anything, build and direct towards things.<p>An odd thing to look back and see that you start to forget the things you have work on because you get the real gift of volunteering - an ability to be a doer and use it in other areas of your life.<p>My volunteer experience is as odd as it is varied, and I get to be able to use a lot of it in my professional life, from the small things of helping where needed at a table, whether it&#x27;s event planning it&#x27;s starting a tiny conference and growing it to 300 people for many years, or learning the logistics of organizing a parade for over 20,000 people for a decade, and recently organizing tens of thousands of meals for volunteers during a disaster fire, I have picked up valuable skills such as being a driving force in raising funds (totalling in the hundreds of thousands) for universities, food banks, and other disasters.<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter if the volunteering role is big, or small.  Small things that are meant to click, do, and you get to serve something that hopefully will out live you for 5-10-20 years.<p>I&#x27;m studying what&#x27;s different about the positive volunteer movements that seem to last a very long time (and outgrow the founder and continue on for 50-100 years.)<p>So far, I sense it&#x27;s about the ability for future volunteers to have the experience of depth and quality of connections, not quantity.

Deep Video Analytics is developed using Django, Postgres, Tensor Flow &amp; Docker to enable flexible deployment.

They don&#x27;t even necessarily have to know why they&#x27;re doing it or what it ought to look like in an applicant, but they look for it anyways. So ways to make sure you&#x27;re ticking this checkbox are making sure you&#x27;re enthusiastic about coding and speak with excitement about what you&#x27;re doing and the be excited about the company&#x27;s core values. For example, most companies are consumer facing, so you need to get jazzed about providing the best user experience possible and be motivated by seeing people use your product and interacting with users and their feedback. The best advice I could give here is to make sure you do your research on the company, tailor your resume&#x2F;cover letter&#x2F;responses to match them, and just fake it till you make it.<p>Personal Projects: The other piece that applicants tend to not have (particularly people just entering the field) is solid portfolio work. One key aspect of that is open source contributions. Get excited by a framework or a library and not only become an expert on it, but get involved in the developer community and start contributing to the project on  Github. The other important piece is projects that are real. Something that is original and actually solves a problem, something that people outside of your circle have used. Everyone and their mother has class assignment projects or online tutorial walkthroughs (kanbans, todo list, simple fetch from api and display, personal website). Only a very small fraction of people coming out of college or a bootcamp have a project that goes beyond the basics and teeters on being an actual product.<p>So my advice is to put more emphasis on those two aspects, make sure you&#x27;re getting involved in the community online and in person via meetups (referrals are gold and trump just about anything), and avoid shotgunning for interviews (pick a few companies and focus on them).","time":1493306134,"type":"comment"},{"by":"pseshadri","id":14216452,"kids":[{"by":"dsacco","id":14229182,"parent":14216452,"text":"This is basically the worst way you can attempt to get a job.

A little over a year ago I moved to NYC to attend a Full Stack Python Coding Bootcamp. I flew through the course, and upon finishing had bright eyes and a lot of enthusiasm to begin a career in tech. The teachers threw their support behind me, and let me know that I was a strong developer (and more importantly a fast learner) and should have no problem finding a job. Fast forward to now - I have been looking for a career full time since July 2016 with no luck. I’ve been interviewing a lot, but ultimately get passed over for people with more experience. I’m going into debt at this point, and don’t know where to turn or what to do to get my shot.<p>I know companies here are really pressing a CS degree - which I don’t have. I do have a BS in Petroleum Engineer, and have work experience as an engineer. I also managed a Oil &amp; Gas service company in Africa for years before making this transition, so I have quality professional experience. I left my career to embark on this journey into technology, so I have proof of my passion and commitment to this change. I’m not sure where to turn or what to do at this point, but I know I want to be working in tech.<p>I have been a finalist for many jobs, but no offers to date. Some companies are great about going in another direction and giving feedback, and other companies give me none. Last month I interviewed at Foursquare - two phone interviews, a project, two more in person interviews - wait two weeks and receive a generic email (“While we felt your experience was great, it didn&#x27;t quite align with what we&#x27;re looking for at this time.”). I’ve sent emails asking for more feedback and received no replies.<p>If you have any thoughts as to what I can to do get my first job in technology, I would be grateful."},"14191791":{"by":"coffeebite","id":14191791,"score":1,"time":1493110104,"title":"Padlet is bringing intuitive collaboration to everyone.

I have no idea what progress this is tracking.  It seems to bounce back to full after going to empty, and since each cycle appears vaguely related to the progress of the text, I assume there is some connection.  However, it isn&#x27;t clear.<p>3- There are four blue boxes below the reverse progress bar, which are mostly empty but occasionally have words in them.  And if I click in the area, they adopt colors, one green and if wrong, the others red.  However, it seems like the translation of the lyric that is in red matches the translation in green, and the other words in the remaining 3 boxes are red.  Wouldn&#x27;t it make more sense to make the lyric highlighted in green, so you can visually see that it matches the word in green? The fact that the selection is wrong can be indicated by setting the background of the answer area red, rather than making the red appear in the lyric itself.<p>4- The instructions only appeared on the third video I watched, the first two I either didn&#x27;t see the one line instruction or it didn&#x27;t appear.  Probably the former, so it might make sense for the instruction line to appear for a longer period of time.<p>5- The text boxes move around, it would be much easier and effective for me if I could press 1 2 3 or 4 to select the appropriate box.  The mistakes I&#x27;ve made so far are mostly getting the pointer in the correct position, rather than not knowing which is the correct translation.<p>6- With understanding that &quot;everyone is a critic&quot;: I found the music selection annoying, at least in the English-&gt;French series.<p>7- With understanding that &quot;I have no idea of your intended profit model&quot;: it seems very challenging to get breadth and depth in terms of the number of languages, dialects, and songs out there.  One possibility that other language-learning tools have used is crowd-sourcing the data, i.e. enabling users of the site to input videos, lyrics, timings, difficulty levels, perhaps even offer ratings and corrections.<p>8- While linguician makes a nice adjunct to primary language learning, and I can see the charms of sharing culture along with language, and having video that may provide more cues to meaning, it seems that there is some ideal threshold in terms of comprehensibility for language learning.  For example, I&#x27;ve heard that an ideal scenario is one at which the language learner is always in a state of roughly 90% comprehensible speech, but in linguician it doesn&#x27;t seem scalable in terms of comprehensibility.  Contrast this to, for example, Earworms MBT, which for a new language learner is totally comprehensible and slowly builds up.<p>9- Having gone through the painful adult language learning process multiple times, I feel that adding relative scores adds some way for users to feel where they are at.<p>10- The lyrics on the first three videos I selected took approximately 20 seconds to load, which seems a bit excessive given that 20 seconds of HD video have been downloaded by that point.<p>11- The progress bar, which I believe is a timeout counter for selecting the appropriate response, begins its countdown significantly before the target phrase is shown on the screen.<p>12- Now it appears the videos have a dual selection, &quot;I want to know this&quot; versus &quot;I already know this&quot;, which probably has to do with the path taken to get to the video.  This seems like somewhat of a waste of time -- either teach or test, or explain what the point is.<p>13- The videos say &quot;press play on the video to start&quot;, but the videos begin playing automatically anyway.<p>14- Having a way to see or hide a full translation of a song may be useful to get the flavor of a song&#x27;s overall meaning.<p>15-  Not sure what the black music note in the red circle at the top right of each video is supposed to do.<p>16- There are multiple errors in the English translations, e.g. &quot;they live&quot; for &quot;their lives&quot; I believe, but it&#x27;s very difficult to enumerate them without the ability to select text to copy and paste.<p><i>In summary: This is really a great platform, I look forward to seeing where this goes!</i>","time":1493081203,"type":"comment"},{"by":"trevyn","id":14190060,"kids":[{"by":"trevyn","id":14191387,"kids":[{"by":"ro-_-b","id":14193014,"parent":14191387,"text":"Great - thank you for the comment.

I stated missing the engagement of actually continuing work on a project, instead of just showing up, doing a bit, and moving on.<p>These days if I became a consultant I would spend a lot more time on choosing a positioning that would still be specific, but allow for a broader set of clients.

Yes, a consultant works for themselves in the sense that they don&#x27;t get twenty paid vacation days a year and an iPhone with unlimited data and subsidized health insurance. But a consultant works for their clients and does what they want and has no bureaucratic excuses for not doing so. When the client likes green, it&#x27;s green or something better and when the client likes ponies, it&#x27;s a pony or something better. And here the only measure of something better is by the client and the consultant is responsible for showing them the thing they think the client might find better and the consultant has to live with all those times that the client still wants a green pony.<p>My random advice from the internet is don&#x27;t quit a day job until the contracts are signed  <i>and</i> retainer checks have cleared.<p>Good luck.","time":1493136359,"type":"comment"},{"deleted":true,"id":14202298,"parent":14191043,"time":1493208721,"type":"comment"},{"by":"BjoernKW","id":14191936,"kids":[{"by":"drogonmead","id":14194402,"kids":[{"by":"BjoernKW","id":14195314,"parent":14194402,"text":"Yes, 25% is the least amount of your time you have to spend on marketing and sales in order to keep up a sustainable business and that&#x27;s absolutely the case for me.

I am obsessed about quality of performance and quality of output.  This has its pros and cons:<p>Pros<p>My little tool can do things other more popular tools cannot do, tends to be more stable, and executes extremely quickly.  From purely a technology perspective my tool is probably superior in many ways to other similar tools.  This has earned me a super loyal following and allows me freedoms to solve problems, provide enhancements, and solve bugs very quickly.<p>Cons<p>I am so focused on the code and technology that I don&#x27;t perform marketing or advertising of almost any kind.  I am entirely reliant upon organic search results, word of mouth from my users, and occasional feature announcements.  The challenge with this is that I have no control and often no awareness of my traffic.<p>Being obsessed with code quality and product quality the code is very terse and not friendly to many developers.  This means there is less interest from users to submit pull requests to the project.<p>The extremeness of this approach makes the popularity of my tool hard to gauge.  Last year it appeared I was on trajectory to become one of the most popular packages on NPM.  I pulled out of NPM because they kept breaking my package, and so I have completely lost that traffic.  I was about to exceed a million NPM downloads a month almost entirely from direct sources external to NPM.  This is what it means to be obsessed with product quality.<p>The single greatest burst of traffic to the website came when I published a new diff algorithm here last month.  I made the front page for a day and got about 50,000 visitors.<p>What I have learned is:<p>* If you are producing something worthy of demand in a way that is superior to everything else it will eventually get the attention it deserves.  If you are willing to accomplish those things the competition is either incapable or unwilling to accomplish you can compete no matter their funding or popularity.<p>* If the code is harder for newbs to instantly jump into your contribution community will be small or non-existent.<p>* If you damage the availability of your product most of your users will happily transfer their investment into something inferior.  For most people convenience is, to a point, more important than niche features or product quality.<p>* Without any marketing strategy the popularity of your product will grow exponentially (if it is worthy of growth).

It was really hard attracting users when the entire site depends on other users (of which obviously at first we had very little of) for content.<p>However, we did several (mostly automated) things to increase our user count to 26,000+ members, which is where we stand right now. The main goal was to make sure that each user is catered to and getting exactly (or close to) what they are looking for.<p>1. Split up the content into several categories (14 to be exact). This allowed us to focus on specific categories such as  Science, Earth, Politics, etc. Each category has its own social media account (on Twitter, Tumblr, Medium, WP, etc.) where we share our highest voted RELEVANT user-submitted content automatically using IFTTT. Example: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;science.snapzu.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;science.snapzu.com</a><p>2. We also used the same user-submitted content to build our newsletter and send out the top relevant posts of the week for the &quot;tribes&quot; (communities like sub-reddits) that they are subscribed to. This attempts to get as many people to come back and often, a tactic extremely important when the community is dependent on other users coming back and contributing&#x2F;participating.<p>3. We create automatically generated &quot;top list&quot; posts for some of our top categories and share them on all our social channels, newsletters, certain relevant sub-reddits, etc. These again are dependent entirely on user-submitted content, and although I mentioned they are automated, they still require some work (for the intro quote, minor curating) but 95% of the work is automated. Each post takes approx 10-15 minutes to create, instead of several hours, and uses the past week&#x27;s top submissions as the main content. Example: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;snapzu.com&#x2F;teamsnapzu&#x2F;weekly-roundup-earth-and-nature-top-20-stories-of-the-week-of-april-20-27th-2017&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;snapzu.com&#x2F;teamsnapzu&#x2F;weekly-roundup-earth-and-nature...</a><p>4. Obviously there were also several things completely out of our control. Reddit had their massive debacle a couple years ago when Victoria got fired (she hosted their AMAs) which created a massive Reddit &quot;revolt&quot;. Over the course of a few weeks in July 2015 we had 40,000+ people come in from there, of which approximately 8000 signed up. But that obviously would not have happened if we were not &quot;somewhat known&quot; at this point. We were basically at the right place at the right time, as one of the few semi-known Reddit alternatives&#x2F;competitors. Because the &quot;Reddit revolt&quot; was somewhat big news, we also got mentioned in several articles (Daily Dot, Inc, Moz, etc) which brought in a few more thousand users.<p>We&#x27;re now using many of the things we learned from the entire 4 year process of growing our own community platform to help bloggers (and&#x2F;or website&#x2F;business owners) who are struggling with the same things we were (and still are). Many of the growth problems (and eventual tactics) involved are nearly identical mainly because of the chicken and egg problem I mentioned before. If you are curious it&#x27;s at <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogenhancement.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogenhancement.com</a>.

One of them is always to think long perspective (ideally your whole life) - usually problems fade when you put them in longer perspective, you then realise you will definitely work it out since there is such long life before you. In my case this always motivates me to go extra mile, put extra hour to get the work done.<p>Thinking long perspective also helps you to organise your life and set your goals. People who set their goals are often successful at realising them, it&#x27;s astonishing how few actually write their goals down :-) Long perspective gives you feeling of security, that you do have a course set and you know where you are going. There are many ways of achieving goals.<p>Another one is to imagine you failing and realising consequences.

We had libraries in all the languages we were using (php, node js, go, python, c &#x2F; c++) that followed the convention.<p>The convention was simple.  Every log MUST have at least these three parameters: --action, --r, and --t, and one optional one: --p.<p>--action would be the &quot;subject&quot; of the message with a dot notation.  A lot of times it&#x27;s simply class.method or class.method.something.finished.<p>--r is the &quot;request&quot; hash.  This hash represented everything that has happened in the current process to handle whatever was asked of it.  So for a web request, the --r would start as the request came in from nginx, and the --r would end when the response was sent back.<p>--t is the &quot;thread&quot; hash.  If the calling process sent a --t parameter, use that.  Otherwise, generate a new one.<p>--p is the &quot;parent&quot; hash.  If the calling process sent a --r parameter, set that as --p.  Otherwise, don&#x27;t add it.<p>All of this was automated in the logging libraries.  So generally a developer would simply call Log.d(&#x27;whatever&#x27;, {something: &#x27;something something&#x27;}) or Log::d(&#x27;whatever&#x27;, [&#x27;something&#x27;, &#x27;something else&#x27;]);<p>Requiring those four params allows us a couple fantastic things.  First, highlighting the --action field made it a lot like looking at your inbox.  Every message had a subject;  This made for very simple skimming.  Second, when hunting errors, it was very easy to find all the other related log messages by searching for the matching --r(equest) value.  Third, for larger processes that sometimes involved tens of servers, it was easy to generate a tree of the entire request from start to finish, by simply using the --t(hread), --p(arent), and --r(equest) values.<p>These logs were all sent to rsyslog, which forwarded all logs to a central server (Also running rsyslog), which kept up beautifully.  Besides handling the collection and transport for us, it was great to be able to watch the logs centrally - and then on each server when necessary - just by tailing &#x2F;var&#x2F;log&#x2F;syslog.  I had written a couple parsers for our logs on the central server, but eventually, as the project grew, our logs became far too much to handle with simple tailing apps, so we went with ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).<p>Back then we used Logstash for the conversion, but on recent projects, I&#x27;ve just used rsyslog&#x27;s @cee plugin, which skips the &quot;L&quot;.<p>And, over time, we&#x27;d added a few more indices that worked well with kibana dashboards and tables.  The two most useful were --i and --ms.<p>An --i parameter was simply an incrementing int starting at 0 for every new --r(equest hash).  Lots of times our logs came in out of order, so having an explicit incrementing value in the log messages was really handy.   An --ms parameter was for milliseconds.  Any log message that had timed something included an --ms message.  That was most excellent for dashboards.<p>Also, all hashes were simply truncated SHA1 hashes.

Routers assign a ip address to computers within the network and does network address translation, so that externally you can use one ip address to the internet that represents multiple computers. It can track which internal ip address is associated with a request, but computers outside your intranet can&#x27;t, which is why you often use routers to assign specific ports to specific computers in your network so that you can play video games or use bittorrent, as that lets the external networks initiate a connection by using a specified port.","time":1493231873,"type":"comment"},{"by":"JayMatthews","id":14209894,"kids":[{"by":"janwillemb","dead":true,"id":14210618,"parent":14209894,"text":"Thanks","time":1493291336,"type":"comment"}],"parent":14203547,"text":"Here is a good resource that has served me pretty well.

You can go, help younger generations with what you know, with an added benefit of getting to know other mentors, who may help you down the line.\n</code></pre>\nThis is a phase in your life that will pass once you start working in the field.

There&#x27;s tons of books out there that are also good, but this is one I like to recommend as a starting point.<p>Another thing I&#x27;ll do a lot of times when I&#x27;m trying to figure out how to test a weird situation is try to think of another API that works similarly and look to see if it has any tests that are instructive. And I habitually go through OSS projects I use to look at their tests and see what techniques I might not know about.  This is really useful when you&#x27;re picking up a new language or paradigm (e.g. when I started using functional languages over the OO languages I was used to.)<p>The basic thing you need to remember about testing is the AAA approach[2]: Arrange (setup); Act(do the thing you&#x27;re testing); Assert (measure the outcome to make sure it is what you were expecting). Just about everything you read on testing at a lower level is going to come down to that procedure. There&#x27;s additional techniques like fuzz testing and property testing, but they&#x27;re not common.  At a junior level I&#x27;d just expect you to have a basic understanding of AAA and how to apply it to common situations with the toolkit of your choice (e.g. for a javascript dev, maybe jest).<p>When you think about it, you already test your software, as you write it—its just that instead of writing down the steps in a way that your test framework can use, you&#x27;re doing it manually. So really you just need to learn how to write down what you&#x27;re doing in the browser (or whatever your interface is).  Further refinement of that process is to use break your software up into pieces that can be more easily tested on their own.<p>I really just meant to post the first link, but testing is one of those areas that&#x27;s near and dear to my heart, so my apologies for the rambling :)<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Working-Effectively-Unit-Tests-Fields-ebook&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B00QS2HXUO&#x2F;ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1493390286&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=working+effectively+with+unit+tests\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Working-Effectively-Unit-Tests-Fields...</a><p>[2] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.c2.com&#x2F;?ArrangeActAssert\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.c2.com&#x2F;?ArrangeActAssert</a>","time":1493391136,"type":"comment"},{"by":"larc","id":14219277,"parent":14218970,"text":"Obey the Testing Goat (<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.obeythetestinggoat.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.obeythetestinggoat.com&#x2F;</a>) will take you through creating a small web app (python&#x2F;django) using test driven development.

Building Conduit implementations without tests are a large time investment as is, so we originally didn’t include testing in the spec because we figured that if people wanted it, then it would be a great “extra credit” objective for the repo. For example, the Angular 2 repo had a request for unit tests and folks are now starting to work on a PR for it.<p>Another reason we didn’t include them in the spec is actually from this line in the current spec:<p>&gt; The quality &amp; architecture of Conduit implementations should reflect something similar to an early stage startup&#x27;s MVP: functionally complete &amp; stable, but not unnecessarily over-engineered.<p>Most startups I know that work in consumer facing apps (like Conduit) don’t apply TDD until they have solid product-market fit, which is smart because they then spend most of their time iterating on product &amp; UI and thus are far more likely to find PMF.<p>This doesn’t mean that TDD === over-engineering, but in certain circumstances that statement does evaluate true (ex: consumer product finding PMF, sideprojects, robust prototypes, etc).<p>So TL;DR — we chose to not have a strict requirement for TDD in these repos, but we&#x27;d definitely prefer all of them to include excellent tests if the maintainers are willing to add it (or if someone in the community is kind enough to make a pull request :)","time":1493255669,"type":"comment"},{"by":"antrix","id":14199700,"parent":14198641,"text":"They have a point though, testing patterns are absolutely a real world concern.","time":1493168911,"type":"comment"}],"parent":14198441,"text":"Then make a pull request that adds TDD. :)<p>But seriously, these apps are large enough where adding in testing initially would only complicate the core mission: to show the common software patterns that are required for day to day development.","time":1493158643,"type":"comment"},{"by":"mchandleraz","id":14208274,"parent":14198441,"text":"I&#x27;m actually working on the Vue.js implementation (with some help from a few other folks already) and am doing my best to write tests as I go.

There is no other approach to take, as you must before anything else establish your credibility as a writer within a domain of knowledge.<p>A news site is a far different proposal.

This isn&#x27;t even a question. The answer is yes. The ubiquitous &#x27;clean, modern, &quot;Tech is neat! :D Business and advertising! :D Everything is safe! :D&quot; aesthetic&#x27; is wrong. It&#x27;s a monolithic lie, and we all know it.<p>The biggest contributing factor to the decline of the cyberpunk aesthetic in the 80&#x27;s-90&#x27;s was how quickly it became realism. If you read a William Gibson novel now, it would be like reading William Faulkner in the 1800&#x27;s.<p>(I know Faulkner didn&#x27;t publish in the 1800&#x27;s. don&#x27;t go there, this is my reply and that means I decide how time works here.)<p>The implications of the use of the advanced tools we build on the individual, and the species as a whole, is rarely considered with the gravity it deserves, at least by the vast majority of end users, I believe, in large part, because capitalism is predatory, and subsequently the tools it uses to accomplish it&#x27;s end must be uniformly masked, behind a layer of safe aesthetics. A revival of the cyberpunk aesthetic in general, which paints technology as dangerous, empowering, and hints that the deeper into the technical details you get, the more empowered you become, would be a welcome return to realism from the magazine glossy, UI&#x2F;UX of modern services. I mean seriously, this &quot;Mumblecore&quot; jargon and friendly faces on services which, let&#x27;s be frank here, are simply the injections of profit and information siphoning mechanisms (the successful ones anyway) into monetary transactions for goods and services, and exchanges of information, between people, which already existed, in exchange for a razor-thin layer of convenience, and a gross distortion to their psychological faculties for perceiving value, to the end of contributing to the centralization of money, thus access to resources, and data, thus the ability to derive information, into the hands of a few, and creating (I&#x27;m trying my best to tone down the hyperbole here) impermeable veil of branding, that obfuscates as completely as possible, what anything actually is, or does.<p>(Don&#x27;t go there. It&#x27;s my reply, that means I can nest as many clauses in a statement as I want.)<p>If your blog even piques someone&#x27;s curiosity, or contributes peripherally to a compulsion to dig deeper into how the layers of complex systems underlying the mechanisms we use to interact with the world now work, it was worth every minute you spent on it up to that point. Seriously, do it.<p>Speaking from personal experience, if you had shown me an ad for a &quot;coding bootcamp&quot; when I was 10, I would have chosen.. literally anything else to get into. Fortunately, I got my hands on a copies &quot;Hell: A Cyberpunk Thriller&quot;, and &quot;Shadowrun&quot; instead. The sentiment of that art, the feeling of those ideas, with regards to technology, has kept my interest alive through day after day of questioning whether or not this specific impending bout of &#x27;meeting business requirements&#x27; in which I am about to engage means I am a terrible person.<p>Just do it dude.

The only way to do it right is to add each feature as if all your customers were going to use it, but instead, people cut corners and write features in such a way that they only support the targeted customer(s).  They compound the problem by adding special cases in the business logic to make sure the feature doesn&#x27;t affect other customers even though it&#x27;s broken for them.  They add features for one customer that aren&#x27;t even logically coherent for other customers.  They lower their sights from &quot;make this code work for every valid set of inputs&quot; to &quot;make this code work for all of our current customers, except the ones who won&#x27;t notice because they don&#x27;t use this feature yet.&quot;<p>The result is completely unmaintainable.  You can&#x27;t change anything because every piece of data has accidentally acquired special meaning.<p>&quot;You can&#x27;t remove the dog_shave_preferences column!

The aim is to answer the questions how to learn X programming language&#x2F;framework&#x2F;platform and what are the best resources to use.<p>* provide a Stackoverflow like QA section for users to ask and answer questions.<p>* provide a forum to submit and discuss learning resources (like HN)<p>* provide a chatroom to replicate the IRC experience<p>As you can see this I have completely failed to convey this. So that&#x27;s what I am working on now : to convey the purpose of the site and improve the UX and UI.

The hard part is getting users to keep coming back to your site aka engagement.<p>The best advice I have come across to get your initial users : do things that don&#x27;t scale [0]. Yeah, everyone read that post by PG but a surprisingly small number of people actually apply it to their own projects&#x2F;startups. Practical example : I am building a community for programmers [1], so to get some initial feedback I posted to a Python subreddit and got the first 50 users. I got a lot of valuable feedback, but users hardly came back to my site after a couple of days. So I decided to follow up individually with users who had signed up and started a conversation about my site. I explained to each user what the site is about, how to use it and asked for feedback. I also asked them what their first impressions of the site were and how it can be improved. I learnt that people did not even understand what my site was about, and I knew that I need to focus on conveying the essence of the site to new users. (Still working on it) You gain a lot of insight about users by having conversations with individual users. I managed to help 3 people with their Python related problems so far, in the chat room <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.metalmanac.com&#x2F;topics&#x2F;python&#x2F;chat&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.metalmanac.com&#x2F;topics&#x2F;python&#x2F;chat&#x2F;</a><p>Once you get a small number of users who are passionate about your project, continue talking to individual users and ask them to share it with their friends and offer to guide each user individually, it works very well. This is obviously not scalable beyond a few hundred users, but getting those passionate users initially is critical. I am currently at this stage.<p>Once you have a group of 100 or so passionate users, you can share it with a wider community of users (eg- PH, HN for tech projects) and continue focusing on having conversations with individual users.<p>[0] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;paulgraham.com&#x2F;ds.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;paulgraham.com&#x2F;ds.html</a><p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.metalmanac.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.metalmanac.com&#x2F;</a>","time":1493106711,"type":"comment"},{"by":"r_singh","id":14192747,"parent":14191161,"text":"At my previous startup which was a home scrap pickup service in India, we acquired our first few hundred users with word of mouth, offline event participation (in an exhibition) and getting an article in a local newspaper.<p>The exact path to getting the users will differ based on what you&#x27;re attempting to do.

Everyone else will just extract the higher level &quot;insight&quot; from the keywords and move on.<p>I&#x27;ll share a story.  There is a very successful company called Ravean, they sell coats and sleeping bags with heated linings.  They&#x27;ve done several million on Kickstarter over the past few years.  The founder of Ravean did some interviews and explained his ad strategy.  He said initially he tried advertising with keywords targeting camping and outdoor consumers.  Eventually, after burning up 7 or 8 grand, he erased all his keywords and targeted crowdfunding enthusiasts with keywords like &quot;Kickstarter&quot;, &quot;Indiegogo&quot; and &quot;crowdfunding.&quot;  He claims his conversion rates jumped way, way up.  In the interviews, he says &quot;I should charge for this advice.&quot;  Now he <i>does</i> charge for it:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ravean.com&#x2F;crowdfunding&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ravean.com&#x2F;crowdfunding&#x2F;</a><p>So, even though there is a freely accessible interview, online, where this guy gives away his knowledge, he still makes money selling the same advice to other people.  There is such a sea of information out on the web that any one thing is very likely to get lost.<p>The Ravean advertising trick is as close to the scenario you mentioned, and here I am, sharing it with HN.  But how many people will really read this comment?  How many will be doing crowdfunding campaigns in the near future?  How many will immediately jump on the advice?  Will it move the CPC needle?

Does your son have an interest in something related to programming? How are your son&#x27;s reading, writing and typing skills? Programming, by nature, is very deliberate. Misspellings and typos can cause a world of hurt for an experienced dev and could be even more frustrating for a kid. A lot of programming is less about the language than it is about the concepts.<p>In light of the above, I am going to make an out of the box suggestion...<p>Buy a Lego Mindstorms kit. Build a robot with him and then use the software to put together basic programs for the robots with the programming software that is included. You will be able to teach him simple if statements, loops, conditionals, variables, etc all without having to worry about what language to use and without him worrying about spacing and punctuation.<p>When I was a kid I loved doing this. I was always playing with Mindstorms, setting up courses, and seeing if my programming lets them work their way out of them. I also would set up different courses for the two types of wheels that came with my kit. I had to learn that bumper sensors had to be out further than the wheels. I had to be able to turn on and off motors for the right length of time to make the robots turn. I could use light sensors and I even tried to figure out how to make it annoy my sister. There was some building, sure, but a lot of my time was spend &quot;programming&quot; with the Mindstorms software.<p>Then I tried to jump to C++ or C# (cannot remember) when I was 9-11 and I was miserable. Granted, my parents had no programming experience and I tried to kind of do it on my own, but it was a bit much for me. I just didn&#x27;t enjoy it and quickly left it alone.<p>If your son enjoys Mindstorms, maybe in 12-24 months you guys can start with real electronics and a formal programming language. The cool part is (especially if you have an interest) this (ie. hobby electronics and programming them) is something that could be something you do with your son that lasts a lifetime.

They&#x27;ve been shaped by our own past experiences and views of what&#x27;s important or useful at large.<p>Students, especially young students, are still forming their worldviews. It&#x27;s possible to condition them to think one way, but these views will always feel &quot;forced&quot; or &quot;alien&quot; compared to views they arrive at themselves.[^1]<p>Thus, it&#x27;s important that the students drives the learning. This is largely done by <i>perpetually asking questions</i>. Knowing the answer without being intimately aware of the question is nearly useless. Curious students will ask better questions, internalize the knowledge better, and drive their own learning.<p>As it turns out, this applies to all learning, not your specific question related to programming&#x2F;computing. Let&#x27;s explore that question next:<p>2. <i>Prioritize computational thinking.</i><p>Specific choice of languages in industry come and go. You identify this trend yourself: in recent years languages like Go and Elixer appear to be gaining popularity, perhaps even at the expense of languages like Ruby or Java. Whatever the general trend maybe, language choices always vary. However, there are two tenets which remain relatively constant.<p>a. <i>&quot;Computational Thinking&quot; provides a framework for problem solving</i><p>Computational Thinking, as popularized by Jeanette Wing[^2], basically just means thinking about solving problems in a way that formulating the solution resembles the process by which you could encode the solution on a computer. Regardless of the choice of language, programmers and computer scientists still approach problems algorithmically and formulaically. This skill set is more important than knowledge of any particular language.<p>b. <i>Language paradigms change infrequently</i><p>Across all the industrial trends in language choice, languages in popular use can largely be categorized by the extent to which they utilize two paradigms: the imperative paradigm, where programs are built of a series of state mutations, and the functional paradigm, where programs are built from mathematical functions with a focus on composition.<p>Familiarity with both of these paradigms is important, and indeed they complement each other.[^3][^4] Most languages are not purely functional nor purely imperative. However, being able to recognize and identify these features will facilitate learning new languages as they arise.<p>3. <i>Embrace child-like wonder.</i><p>As we get older, there&#x27;s increasing pressure to not be &quot;surprised.&quot; People say things like, &quot;Wait, you didn&#x27;t know that? Everyone knows that.&quot; As a result, we are conditioned to contain our excitement when learning new things.<p>As it turns out, people are learning and getting excited about things all the time. Excitement is infectious; if you are always excited and passionate about the things you&#x27;re learning (or teaching!), that excitement will spread to those around you.<p>&gt; <i>Never lose sight of that child-like wonder. It&#x27;s just too important. It&#x27;s what drives us.</i><p>&gt; -- Randy Pausch, <i>The Last Lecture</i><p>—————<p>[^1]: Cf.

Forums like this one are generally a good sniff test. I then subscribe to mailing lists that deal with that tech. I clip a lot of articles and code snippets to a datastore (Evernote in my case) where I can peruse my notes later. I install said tech and build little micro apps and generally futz around and have a good time. The key here is to be interested in the tech you are trying to learn. Maybe you are bored with C&#x2F;C++? Whats the harm in looking at something totally different like Ruby or NodeJS? They might give you ideas or a different way of looking at things. Whatever it is, try to have fun. Learning doesn&#x27;t have to be all drudgery.<p>When I want to take a deep dive (usually after a good bit of research mentioned above) I find a job working with the tech in question. Nothing will force me into gaining a deep deep understanding of a technology or concept like getting thrown into the deep end. After a year or two at that job, I emerge a ninja level dev in that area. Not a bad deal if you ask me. If that approach is too extreme maybe you can just set up a side project or contribute to open source?

I think a lot of it starts with motivation. If you are just studying something for fun then the boring stuff does get really tedious. But if you are studying for something beyond the subject, eg, in my case it was acing my degree to prove something to myself, then the competitive side takes over.<p>There are people out there that devote themselves to memorizing decks of cards or arbitrarily long numbers. Cards or random numbers are not particularly interesting, so these folks invent mind games. They may take each card to represent a particular object and then make up some crazy story involving these objects. Suddenly to them what was mindbogglingly dull becomes tantamount to some epic screen play.<p>You can employ similar tricks to studying any subject. When studying for my degree there were a few things that really helped. Note taking, notes had to be as vivid as possible. I would always have multiple coloured pens and highlights as possible. Pictures, various sized and coloured text and lots of arrows. My notes became art. Mnemonics and stories were important for the long lists of things.<p>Also managing energy levels is pretty important. Regular sleep cycles, exercise help maintain focus. Environment makes a big difference. A library is much better than the common room.. Also, slightly controversially, I find the often given advice to take regular breaks when studying was highly damaging. If I allow regular breaks, then my focus shifts to watching for when my next break is. Also in the breaks I would get time to think about how dull this stuff was. So I would find maintaining pure focus for about 4 hours at a stretch much easier. It helps to have a variety of studying techniques to move around in.
