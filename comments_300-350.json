A normal image is 1024 x 1024 pixels. Using a technique called &quot;summation&quot; the cameras have the ability to combine pixels together to get smaller but less noisy images. This results in smaller images that take a lot less time to readout out and take up less data volume. Summation is very useful if a scientist needs to conserve both. In the 2 x 2 mode, the camera takes a 2 x 2 pixel square and averages those values into a single pixel. Images in this mode will be 512 x 512 pixels. In the 4 x 4 mode, the camera takes a 4 x 4 pixel square and makes that a single pixel. Images in this mode are 256 x 256 in size.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;saturn.jpl.nasa.gov&#x2F;faq&#x2F;#raw_images\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;saturn.jpl.nasa.gov&#x2F;faq&#x2F;#raw_images</a>","time":1493389042,"type":"comment"},{"by":"DonbunEf7","id":14219001,"parent":14210691,"text":"Amazing","time":1493384512,"type":"comment"}],"id":14210691,"score":134,"url":"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/nasa-spacecraft-dives-between-saturn-and-its-rings","by":"danparsonson"},"14213744":{"time":1493318304,"type":"story","descendants":126,"title":"Who Is Publishing NSA and CIA Secrets, and Why?","kids":[{"by":"jwtadvice","id":14214112,"kids":[{"by":"hackuser","id":14214826,"kids":[{"by":"empath75","id":14215055,"kids":[{"by":"jwtadvice","id":14215147,"kids":[{"by":"hackuser","id":14215207,"kids":[{"by":"jwtadvice","id":14215262,"kids":[{"by":"hackuser","id":14216891,"kids":[{"by":"jwtadvice","id":14222538,"parent":14216891,"text":"Yup.<p>Regarding the differences it&#x27;s important to both compare and contrast.<p>The US likes to try to color Russian propaganda as &quot;evil&quot; or &quot;illegitimate&quot; or &quot;propaganda based on lies&quot; or some such other nonsense.

Also, we cannot wait until we have certain evidence of propaganda to point it out: It&#x27;s very rarely certain that something is propaganda - that would be poor execution indeed, violating its basic purpose - so we cannot give propaganda the benefit of the doubt, wait for certainty to call it what it is, and therefore empower it. That benefit of the doubt is normal, healthy good faith, but propaganda is a parasite on good faith; good faith is a tool of manipulation for propaganda, used to take advantage of others.<p>Here are some techniques I know; I&#x27;d be interested in more or where I can find useful research and expertise about it:<p>* Create uncertainty. The strategy is not to persuade people, but to create enough uncertainty to disable them and disable debate. One way to do this is to question every possible flaw in the evidence; in reality, nothing is so clear-cut that there aren&#x27;t questions (and that especially applies to intelligence operations).<p>* Make many baseless claims in order to force others onto defense and occupy all their resources. A baseless allegation takes seconds to make but hours or days to defend. Also, many people remember only the first headline, the baseless allegation, and don&#x27;t see the followup story. Again, it&#x27;s a way of disabling debate.<p>By design, it&#x27;s tough to deal with propaganda - it&#x27;s tough to continue intelligent, valuable discussion in the face of it. I&#x27;m not sure of the answer, but comments matching those techniques, such as the parent, seem to appear when Russia is discussed, for example.<p>One thing I do is to look for whether the comment adds substantive knowledge to the debate, or whether it just increases uncertainty about others and includes baseless information (unsubstantiated claims and rumors). Do I know more about the subject after reading the comment, or less?<p>EDIT: Clarified my purpose in the first paragraph.","time":1493328158,"type":"comment"},{"by":"frabbit","id":14214226,"kids":[{"by":"meesles","id":14214374,"kids":[{"by":"frabbit","id":14214789,"parent":14214374,"text":"I disagree that I am &quot;giving up the will to question and criticize&quot;.<p>On the contrary I criticize the fevered speculations in the media based upon unverifiable sources reputedly in secret agencies over which most elected lawmakers have little or no control and oversight, let alone civilians peeking at the shadows on the window blinds.<p>It&#x27;s a disgusting situtation of asymmetrical information which ought to cause outrage, indignation and fear in anyone that considers themselves free and sovereign.<p>Steepling learnedly on HN, or in &quot;security blogs&quot; may stroke the egos or pump the reputations of the aediles gazing upon the entrails of our democracy, but it does little to expose what only a fully legally empowered commission akin to the Church commision could determine.<p>The only thing we know for sure thanks to Snowden and Wikileaks is that there are large numbers of dominant authoritarians spying on us and and an even large number passive authoritarians settling comfortably into their dungeon.<p>Meanwhile:  THE RUSSIANS ARE COMING!!!!","time":1493327868,"type":"comment"}],"parent":14214226,"text":"Unfortunately that attitude does little to help or try to discover what has happened.

I learned originally about indexing from the &quot;Managing Gigabytes&quot; book, and that&#x27;s the reason for the name, but the book is now completely obsolete, and, even at that time, it contained a significant number of red herrings. There&#x27;s no connection or code or idea sharing of any kind.<p>2) MG4J is our playground for doing research in information retrieval. This means, for example, that we designed new data structures, such as Elias-Fano indexing, which make MG4J have ridiculously faster times in benchmarks (see <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lintool&#x2F;IR-Reproducibility\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lintool&#x2F;IR-Reproducibility</a>). Elias-Fano is now the main Facebook indexing algorithm and it is slowly percolating to Lucene (look in the sources).<p>3) You can define your queries using a very rich interval language with a very fast implementation based on new algorithms. You can easily create parallel indices with text and tagging and ask whether a phrase falls into an area tagged as &quot;location&quot;, for example.<p>2) MG4J is a project of two people and at this time I&#x27;m the only maintainer. You cannot expect that it is refined as Lucene or Solr. But you can very easily hack into it (even without modifying the sources), which is why it has been popular with people experimenting with indexing. For example, there are many tools to manipulate index, splitting them with a specified strategy, combining them, etc.<p>3) So if you want an out-of-the-box solution for indexing, forget about it. If you want a fun playground for doing research or a very efficient backbone on which to build your infrastructure, MG4J might be useful to you.

Then you go to implement it, and as soon as you leave the perfect world of their demo, it all falls apart, and THEN you find out the docs were written for the beta version, and no longer apply, so you&#x27;re left guessing at the right invocation signature for the method you need.<p>My most-recent example of this was their Ruby bindings for Azure blob storage. I wasted DAYS fiddling with the docs, which showed MANY different ways to call the functions, none of which worked for me. I eventually had to have a discussion with one of the people linked to the documentation to get it to work. This sort of thing -- announcing new stuff that isn&#x27;t ready for prime time -- has happened before (I&#x27;m looking at you, EF and WSL), and I expect it will continue to happen, because MS is usually playing catchup with other market hotness.<p>I haven&#x27;t used them, but I have no problem assuming that, if I were to go startup a project with the bleeding edge of, say, Erlang, or Node.js, I could find enough documentation to get a working prototype up and running without a lot of hassle.<p>I guess it goes both ways, though.

The &quot;blessed&quot; way of doing an update is to retrieve an object from your context, change its properties, and call SaveChanges on the context. Yes, this can be terribly inefficient, particularly if you&#x27;re trying to update many rows at once. But it works okay for single-row updates in a CRUD app at the expense of having to run the SELECT first plus all the reflection and change tracking.<p>If you want to do fast, single-call updates without first doing a SELECT, or updates on just a few of the row&#x27;s columns, since that can&#x27;t easily be done with tracked objects, you&#x27;re swimming upstream against what ORMs are designed to do and so your best option is to get out of ORM land and do a SQL query.

My best friend did the same when I was in my mid 20s, and it really wrecked me. 14 years later, I _still_ sometimes have a really hard time with it. I still visit his parents once a year and play my violin for them--the same piece he requested in his suicide note that I play at his funeral.<p>For a couple of years after he died, I was really angry and depressed--perfect mood for a classical musician, really. But I wasn&#x27;t getting any better. After a while, I decided to start trying to understand what was in his head better.<p>He was always a brilliant Mathematician and Software Developer and Philosopher.

At first I worked on his dreams and took them as far as I could make sense of them. Then I started realizing I was forming my own dreams and goals wrt technology stuff. And I started chasing those.<p>I have a good life now. Better and happier than I was as a musician. I was a far happier person 4 years after he died than I was before he died. He changed my life and opened up a world to me that I didn&#x27;t know about while he was alive. And he did it again after he died.<p>I&#x27;m sure that with the suicide rates being what they are in the U.S. that most people have been touched in some way by this particular pain.

If you look at, say, Instagram it is growing rapidly. Specifically to Facebook, the issue is 3 pronged:<p>- Disassociated Graph. The truth is the friends you had in high school and your family are all great but it is highly likely you don&#x27;t share a lot of things in common with them. For example, your love for kayaking and the outdoors might resonate with no one on your graph. Instagram, and other networks like it, you build graphs based on interest. If your Instagram account is about the outdoors, it is highly likely everyone else will be outdoors people as well. That&#x27;s more rewarding.<p>- Bad Content. Graph aside, the content is terrible. The feed is full with click-bait articles, and fake news. You actually feed bad after spending any time on Facebook because you know it is was a waste.<p>- Ads. A good chunk of your feed now is full of ads. Terrible ads. Instagram, for example, is a relatively clean interface.<p>I would say Facebook is clearly on the decline based on the above but to say all networks are on the decline is false. Instagram has proven otherwise and there will be other networks, in the same Instagram vein, that will grow quickly as well.<p>Lastly, all of these networks and messengers have one glaring flaw. They isolate you. President Obama touched upon this a week ago. They do little to connect you with your surroundings and I would hardly call any of them &quot;social networks.&quot; They don&#x27;t connect you to your neighborhood, your city, and the places you frequent the most. It is pretty shocking, but most Americans now only, on average, have about 2.5 friends they see regularly in real-life and most people don&#x27;t even know who their neighbors are.

After years of water privatization which drove costs up for municipalities and quality down, there&#x27;s a reversal towards public management of the water supply. Privatization and deregulation pushed the market to an oligopoly of three main actors, Veolia, Suez and SAUR which eliminated competition and pushed costs up for consumers for a worse quality of water. That trend that was before celebrated (and embraced in the US, with Veolia and Suez heavily active there), is now being full on reversed, with measurable benefits for consumers and municipalities.<p>The US is still lagging behind on that realization and it&#x27;s a common mistake to think that privatizing water supplies holds benefits for towns and consumers. Most often in these cases, deregulation brings benefits in the short term as private actors compete heavily to win public markets, but not in the long term when the market tends to an oligopoly &#x2F; monopoly and private actors don&#x27;t have any more incentive to push on innovation or investments.<p>The issue of lack of investment isn&#x27;t a problem of too much regulation, on the contrary. These are markets with very high costs of entry where you need a strong regulatory framework to mandate a couple actors to a large enough market for those investments to be viable. You quote the example of communications, in France by law France Telecom had to expand its network to reach any citizen, whether 10km away from the grid or 10m at no cost for the consumer.

Because we generated forecasts we had tight time constraints to meet, a 72 hour forecast that takes 100 hours to make is useless.<p>Weather modeling and forecasting is still advancing and even the latest models are not stable simulations (small fluctuations in inputs can cause large fluctuations in output) and this makes the most nuanced data possible desirable. While most commercial systems used 25km polygons covering the earth, ours used 17km polygons when I left. This meant that we had more precise sims and could accurately model further in the future, perhaps by several days. Even faster CPUs and networking might lead to a drop to 8-11km polygons allowing even better predictions. Ideally the meteorologists want to skip the rounding to regional polygons and use the parcels or air model that local forecasters use for the entire world.

Each individual core is rather slow.  The servers themselves are not noticably cheaper in price than x86-based servers.

In particular Qualcomm have a 48 core ARM server SoC which has great performance per core, and should ship in a few months.

Of course the vast majority being phone&#x2F;tablet 32 bit cores, but that kind of volume might mean that future ARM servers become very cheap, or have an incredibly high density of cores.<p>- Multiple vendors are allowed to design ARM SoCs, so we may find that particular vendors optimize for more niche use cases, and if your use case happens to be that niche, that could be a win for you.<p>As an example of the last point: Could your application use 16 x ethernet ports and some custom hardware to process SDN dataplane (eg OpenFlow) tables, all on a single System-on-Chip?  Good luck getting Intel to design such a chip for you.

Here, each outcome  ω can be thought of as a complete\ndescription of the state of the real world\nat the end of the experiment.&quot;<p>The &quot;complete description&quot; part\nis not needed and even if included\nhas meaning that is not clear.<p>Instead, each possible <i>experiment</i> \nis one <i>trial</i> \nand one element in the\nset of all trials Ω. \nThat&#x27;s it:  Ω is just\na set of trials, and each trial\nis just an element of that set.\nThere is nothing there about the\noutcomes of the trials.<p>Next the text has<p>&quot;The sample space is Ω = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.&quot;<p>That won&#x27;t work:  Too soon will find that \nneed an uncountably infinite sample\nspace.  Indeed an early exercise\nis that the set of all events\ncannot be countably infinite.<p>Indeed, a big question was, can\nthere be a sample space big \nenough to discuss random variables\nas desired?  The answer is yes and\nis given in the famous Kolomogorov\nextension theorem.<p>(2) Second Problem -- Notation<p>An <i>event</i> A is an element of\nthe set of all events F\nand a subset of the sample space\nΩ.<p>Then a <i>probability measure</i> P\nor just a <i>probability</i>\nis a function P: F --&gt; [0,1]\nthat is, the closed interval [0,1].<p>So, we can write the probability\nof event A by P(A).\nFine.<p>Or, given events A and B, we can consider  the event C = A U B and, thus, write P(C) = P(A U B).  Fine.<p>But the notes have P(1,2,3,4),\nand that is undefined in the\nnotes and, really, in the rest of\nprobability.  Why?  Because<p>1,2,3,4,<p>is not an event.<p>For the set of real\nnumbers R, a real \n<i>random variable</i> \nX: Ω --&gt; R\n(that is <i>measurable</i>\nwith respect to\nthe sigma algebra F \nand a specified sigma \nalgebra in R, usually\nthe Borel sets,\nthe smallest sigma algebra\ncontaining the open sets,\nor\nthe Lebesgue measurable\nsets).<p>Then an event would\nbe X in {1,2,3,4} subset of R\nor the set of all ω\nin Ω so that X(ω) in\n{1,2,3,4} or<p>{ω| X(ω) in {1,2,3,4} }<p>or the inverse image of\n{1,2,3,4} under X --\ncould write this all more\nclearly if had all of D. Knuth&#x27;s\nTeX.<p>in which case we \ncould write<p>P(X in {1,2,3,4})<p>When the elementary notation\nis bad, a bit tough to\ntake the more advanced\nparts seriously.<p>A polished, elegant\ntreatment of these\nbasics is early in<p>Jacques Neveu, <i>Mathematical Foundations\nof the Calculus of Probability</i>,\nHolden-Day, San Francisco, 1965.<p>Neveu was a student of M.

Before accepting, I had a chat with another recipient, who warned me off. The grant wasn’t a grant at all; you had to take a government appointed ‘advisor’, and when you raised your first round they were entitled to take a percentage of the funds (which could have been a multiple of the original $75k), even if their contribution had been zero. I declined the funding.<p>Applied twice for Commercialisation Australia (2010, $200k) and Early Stage Commercialisation (2014, 100k) grants. Both were grants without taking equity. Spent several thousand dollars and many weeks crafting the strongest possible application.

This proposal was declared unworkable due to rendering high-volume transactional email impossible.<p>But then:<p>1. as you say here, divide everyone&#x27;s email account into a set of &quot;channels&quot; (i.e. subaddresses in a+b@c form, that each have a corresponding message signing key), with one or more <i>published</i> or <i>well-known</i> channels, and then individual <i>private</i> channels for each contact&#x2F;list, or for each conversation(!);<p>2. make MTAs aware of &quot;channels&quot;, and extend both SMTP and email web services to allow users to configure their provider&#x27;s end-of-line MTA, over-the-wire, to set the amount of &quot;postage&quot; required to message each channel they own. (This way, the MTA doesn&#x27;t have to be aware of the distinction between private and public channels; they&#x27;re just destination addresses with a stored config parameter.)<p>3. make the MTAs that use channels, reject any Internet message directed to the base address without a channel. (Messages generated by the MTA itself can arrive without a channel.)<p>4. Set the clients&#x27; default new-channel configurations such that <i>public</i> channels have a cost, and <i>private</i> channels are free.<p>5. In email clients, add a &quot;Subscribe&quot; or &quot;Allow&quot; action-bar item to messages that identify themselves as email-confirmation&#x2F;newsletter-opt-in emails (presumably with a header), that, when clicked, creates a new channel for the sender, and replies to the message with the signing key you want them to use attached. (All this would be hidden from view; the reply message wouldn&#x27;t end up in your Sent Items.)<p>6. In transactional-email-sending services like Sendgrid&#x2F;Postmark&#x2F;etc., create a distinction between &quot;opt-in messages&quot; and &quot;ongoing transactional messages&quot;; allow each account to send one &quot;opt-in&quot; email to each previously-unknown destination-address (and charge for this); but then, for that account, put that destination-address into holding state, where the account can&#x27;t send them any &quot;ongoing transactional messages&quot;, until the email-sending service receives the user&#x27;s conversation key. (You probably want to allow accounts to re-send the opt-in email after a 24-hour-cooldown, though. Though they&#x27;d have to pay again!)<p>7. In any product&#x2F;service backend that uses a transactional-email service, consider new signups unconfirmed until the transactional-service reports (by polling or webhook or whatever) that the user has replied with a key and is now in the &quot;authenticated and free to send to&quot; state.<p>A bit complicated in the initial changes, but in the ongoing state it&#x27;s nearly ideal: it costs money to <i>initiate contact</i> with an address, or to <i>continue pestering</i> an address that doesn&#x27;t want to speak with you, but not to send messages to someone that wants to hear from you. (Though, a user can &quot;unsubscribe&quot; from your list simply by telling their MTA to begin charging you to deliver to their channel again—maybe, UI-wise, by just deleting the channel. Transactional-email sending services could detect the bounced-with-payment-required delivery error, and put the user automatically into an &quot;unsubscribed&quot; state, which could webhook you to let you know!)","time":1493228224,"type":"comment"}],"parent":14202068,"text":"We really need a better solution to fighting spam.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jimktrains&#x2F;email_ng\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jimktrains&#x2F;email_ng</a> is an overly complicated idea I had once, but the basic gist is that the receiver could give the sender a signed receiver email address that is for the sender&#x27;s email address.

I fell in love with vacuum tube era things.  They are beautiful and it&#x27;s all human scale.  You can see the parts.  Back then, I didn&#x27;t have much.  Our family was in poverty a lot of the time.  Reasons.  That&#x27;s not a big deal, and in fact, was of great benefit to me personally.  It kind of forced exploring the world and meaning to get something out of it.  I needed it!<p>Anyway, I had a couple of old ratty texts from the 50&#x27;s era that explained the theory of operation.  And I had various toys and projects that showed parts of that theory to me.  A crystal radio, for example.  I must have reread that text 50 times.<p>At first, I understood very little.  Being young, much of the higher level stuff would blow right by.  But the general concepts were there.<p>So, imagine being faced with the radio.  You don&#x27;t have much, no fancy test gear, etc...<p>I submit Feynman didn&#x27;t fix the radio.  It&#x27;s still broken in a sense.  But, what he did do was make that radio, imperfect or broken, damaged, as it was, perform as needed.  He moved the problem out of the way.<p>This is important.  The radio is a system.  It&#x27;s designed to do a task, and it&#x27;s parts are designed to perform to a specification or other.  Each radio is kind of unique too.  Whatever flaws it has gets compensated for.<p>Problem:  Noise in the radio audio<p>Think real hard:<p>Here, one can start to analyze the radio, take the theory of operation and identify where noise might be coming from.  This means one has sufficient understanding to solve the problem in the first place.  The heavy lift is realizing it!<p>But, say one does not possess that level of understanding.  I didn&#x27;t back then.  Not until many years later, lots of fixes under my belt, and some kind souls giving me test gear.<p>So then, as a system, what&#x27;s still possible?  Fixing the radio may not be an option due to lack of components, understanding, tools.<p>Move the radio\nSwap the tubes\nModify antenna\nChange power source\nChange adjustable things in the radio\nRemove something from the radio\nEtc...<p>For each of these things one CAN do, which of them may resolve noise?<p>In this way, the problem shifts from, &quot;fixing it&quot;, which implies the radio is brought from a flawed state to an acceptable one.  (just less and more minor flaws really)<p>That is what Feynman did.  A poor component at one stage of the radio may perform another task just fine.  Swapping the tubes does that.<p>For many years, I would get this gear from people.  And it was a lot of, &quot;look at the problem&quot;, &quot;think real hard&quot;, &quot;execute solution.&quot;<p>And a bunch of that boiled down to what I could do, not so much what should be done, or needed to be done.  And a lot of that was successful.  Try stuff, observe, try more stuff, observe.  After a time, which stuff to try boiled down to a potent set of things.  More successes.<p>I would get an older TV, for example.  Maybe it had a red tint, or the picture bloomed.  One could make adjustments in the set to re-balance the picture, or improve focus, limit overall brightness, and any number of things to bring that particular system into a functioning order sufficient to perform the task required of it.  Still broken, in the technical sense.  New components would very likely improve it, but a removal of one, or replacement with similar one, even removing one, tweaks to the unit, all could combine to make it perform.<p>In my following of Feynman, I find a consistent theme where he was very good at understanding basic understanding.  The calculus book he refers to contained some general solutions he found could solve a very broad set of problems.  Rather than explore all the solution sets and struggle to apply them, he would take a very useful one and max it out, applying it everywhere.  Where it would not work, or was impractical, he would seek another one.<p>I see this as a very important aspect of this awesome problem solving ability he demonstrated.  Collecting things like this, as well as taking problems from various angles:<p>What can be done, and could it help?\nWhat has been done before?\nWhat should be done.\nCombine things done before.\nGuess at possible new things to be done.\netc...<p>seems to be major contributors to this skill.<p>Feynman often mentioned puzzles.  When you combine a &quot;gauntlet&quot; of puzzles and Feynman&#x27;s natural ability to recognize fundamental understanding with time and a zeal to solve, his remarks about &quot;not being a genius&quot; have some real merit!<p>Now, he was, and that&#x27;s not really a matter of serious debate.  But, the method, to him, is more about doing the work to be lucid.  Solve, solve, solve, refine tools, collect new ones, solve, solve, solve...<p>The difference here, between Feynman, and us ordinary mortals, is the breadth and depth of that lucidity.<p>Those skills I learned in my early youth still apply today.  I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I&#x27;ve arrived at simple ways to &quot;fix&quot; something, just based on what could be done, and inferences on what must be true.  It&#x27;s theory of operation, coupled with broad experience and that &quot;gauntlet&quot; of puzzles run with &quot;the tools&quot;<p>Each of us can do this.  Some of us can do it extremely well in a given domain too.<p>I feel Feynman never did appreciate his skill and lucidity about reality itself, the world, it&#x27;s parts.  Few of us have that.<p>But, the Feynman way of looking at things, solving problems, collecting tools to solve them with, being observant, and inference:<p>What is possible?\nWhat can we do?\nWhat must be true?\nEtc...<p>Is something everyone can cultivate to varying degrees, depending on our affinity for a given domain, personal attributes, and resources.<p>I know this is a zen like argument, but he didn&#x27;t actually fix that radio.  He made a broken one, or flawed one perform better.<p>And in that last bit is an important realization:<p>We state the problem.  Fine.  But, we need to also state the goal too.<p>Given a goal, the problem may be too limiting.  A solution may appear out of reach, or not be seen due to a problem statement constraining things, or masking things.<p>Work backward from the goal and sometimes one can factor the original problem statement away.  And in the doing of that, arrive at a solution that gets it done, or renders the problem a non problem.<p>And I&#x27;ll add Feynman did the work.  A lot of it, and he credits that to a lot of his insights.  Solving a bazillion puzzles will turn anyone into a much better solution finder, and he&#x27;s right about that.<p>Do the work.  Seek the puzzles, and keep at them.  Over time, one gets an internal sort of understanding that is more broadly applicable.","time":1493137647,"type":"comment"},{"by":"throwanem","id":14192110,"kids":[{"by":"rothron","id":14192393,"kids":[{"by":"sideshowb","id":14193012,"parent":14192393,"text":"I think at least one of his &quot;autobiographies&quot; is actually a bunch of his stories recollected by a third party, which doesn&#x27;t help with that impression.","time":1493125121,"type":"comment"},{"by":"j9461701","id":14192463,"kids":[{"by":"ska","id":14193997,"parent":14192463,"text":"I don&#x27;t think that is at all true.
