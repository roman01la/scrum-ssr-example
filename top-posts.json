currently going through a bikeshedding discussion about the log format that our microservices will generate.<p>Developers without Ops responsibilities want the logs to be as readable as possible to aid their development process (traditional timestamp, severity, component, action and a quick description in a single line and, depending on the type of event, maybe a JSON object in many lines with details about the request, possibly with blank lines and indentation to make everything very easy to read).<p>Ops people want the files to be easily parseable for injection into ElasticSearch. They want to avoid complex configuration and want more flexibility to generate reports. If logs were generated in a single line in JSON format, they would be happy.<p>It seems there is no way to please everybody. Are there any standard formats that microservices-oriented architectures are using these days? Is there a standard at all? How to approach this?","time":1493267338,"title":"Ask HN: Best practices for log format?","type":"story"},{"by":"sndean","descendants":0,"id":14230247,"score":11,"time":1493529009,"title":"The fish

coworkers who have generally handled everything from code to deploy. As a result, I feel I lack in expertise about devops that I should know as an engineer. Sideprojects of mine end up going on PaaS services like Heroku or Zeit and I don&#x27;t really learn what it means to set up a server.<p>For instance, I could tell you that you likely have a load balancer (like nginx) which you can use to point routes to different services, and I know that services are going to be things like node instances running my code; but everything I know is fairly superficial and lacking in depth. What is the best way to share secrets? Is there a standard way of having your load balancer know what services to feed to? How does a load balancer that defines routes work with a rails or express instance that also defines routes? Should all my services be built on vagrant, or has docker made that less useful?<p>I&#x27;ve been having trouble filling in these gaps in deep understanding because it seems like every setup is different, so cribbing from convention is not really possible -- and then I read a litany of stories of setups that are wrong in some way and that feeds in to this paralysis of not wanting to do things wrong.<p>I tried setting up a Kubernetes cluster along with Deis, but there are <i>so many layers</i> of different&#x2F;new services that I don&#x27;t know how to conceptually tie those back to a broader understanding. For instance, K8s has a load balancer &#x27;Ingress&#x27; -- does this negate the need for nginx? But then Deis installed its own load balancer so now I have two low balancers for zero services. It&#x27;s just confusing because the big picture is obscured by the novelty of everyones setup.<p>Thank you in advance for your help.","time":1493333940,"title":"Ask HN: Best resource for learning devops as an engineer (js/ruby)?","type":"story"},{"kids":[14199082,14201027,14201023,14200367,14201160,14200647],"score":81,"url":"https://www.1843magazine.com/story/a-practitioners-guide-to-hedonism","by":"tormeh","descendants":50,"id":14198557,"time":1493158034,"title":"A practitioner’s guide to hedonism (2007)","type":"story"},{"kids":[14228917,14225655,14225019],"score":4,"by":"yeodrone","descendants":4,"id":14225008,"text":"I work for a fairly large tech company that is known to make people work 60 hrs.<p>I have 10 yrs of software development  (9 years as hands on) experience.

The teachers threw their support behind me, and let me know that I was a strong developer (and more importantly a fast learner) and should have no problem finding a job. Fast forward to now - I have been looking for a career full time since July 2016 with no luck. I’ve been interviewing a lot, but ultimately get passed over for people with more experience. I’m going into debt at this point, and don’t know where to turn or what to do to get my shot.<p>I know companies here are really pressing a CS degree - which I don’t have. I do have a BS in Petroleum Engineer, and have work experience as an engineer. I also managed a Oil &amp; Gas service company in Africa for years before making this transition, so I have quality professional experience. I left my career to embark on this journey into technology, so I have proof of my passion and commitment to this change. I’m not sure where to turn or what to do at this point, but I know I want to be working in tech.<p>I have been a finalist for many jobs, but no offers to date. Some companies are great about going in another direction and giving feedback, and other companies give me none. Last month I interviewed at Foursquare - two phone interviews, a project, two more in person interviews - wait two weeks and receive a generic email (“While we felt your experience was great, it didn&#x27;t quite align with what we&#x27;re looking for at this time.”).
