My first project in this vein is Composer&#x27;s Sketchpad[1], which aims to explore &quot;freehand composition&quot; by letting users draw notes in strokes directly with their fingers or stylus, bending the pitch and adjusting the length as they go along. The second is MusicMessages![2], in which every note is a button in a giant scroll view, allowing the user to enter and adjust quick melodies with just a few taps.<p>While these apps will never be remotely as powerful as a fully featured DAW, they allow the user to explore certain kinds of musical ideas far more efficiently than with FL Studio or Logic. In my opinion, one of the biggest barriers in creative thinking is the amount of cruft and micro decision-making between the artist and their output, and musical composition is particularly bad at this — there&#x27;s no &quot;lightweight Markdown editor&quot; equivalent for composition quite yet.

An interviewer asks about your interest in the company, your background, your leadership skills.  Your technical skills may be investigated here, but in a discussion format.  You may be asked questions about your knowledge of a database or perhaps a programming language, but you won&#x27;t be tested specifically on that language.<p>Then there&#x27;s the technical &quot;interview&quot; that is really an exam.  Google&#x27;s interview is a good example of this.  You go up to a whiteboard, and the interviewer says &quot;write a method to convert an integer to binary.  Now add and subtract in binary.  How would you square a binary number&quot;.  You should be writing code on the white board, in either a real language or very tight pseudocode, to do this.  Alternatively, the interviewer might ask you to find your way out of a maze, probably through some kind of graph traversal algorithm.  Again, you really do need to write code that solves the problem.<p>This style of interview is indistinguishable from an exam.  I think it exists because programmers don&#x27;t have an actual exam in their field.  It might be similar to asking a senior actuary to find the linear span of a vector space.  There was almost certainly a time when the actuary could do this, since the actuary took an entrance exam on vector calc and linear algebra, but it isn&#x27;t something a senior actuary most likely walks around ready to do.  It would require re-studying.<p>As a few others have pointed out on this thread, there&#x27;s a difference between studying for an exam and prepping for an interview.  I&#x27;ve resolved not to do the latter anymore, but I really may simply not have that choice.  The practice is deeply entrenched.  But the former, of course I&#x27;d prep for an interview.<p>And also, you know, I actually think it&#x27;s a good thing that lawyers take the bar, that actuaries take math exams.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s outrageous that people who hire programmers would want to know that these programmers have, at one time, passed an entrance exam on data structures and algorithms, binary operations, and so forth.  The problem is that because we don&#x27;t have such an exam in our field, we have to take a random and often unexpected version of it, under conditions of secrecy, with no feed back, evaluated by people who may not be qualified and who can be captious and arbitrary in their assessments.","time":1493394800,"type":"comment"},{"by":"stale2002","id":14220371,"kids":[{"by":"vinceguidry","id":14220421,"parent":14220371,"text":"I&#x27;ve interviewed for at least 10 web dev jobs in my career and have never been asked to whiteboard anything.","time":1493394760,"type":"comment"}],"parent":14219500,"text":"What world does this guy live in where he is being asked relevant questions to the stuff that he would be doing at work?<p>Sure,  if we live in this fantasy world,  where the person who passes the interview is by definition going to be good at the job,  then his advice makes sense.<p>Unfortunately, the world we live in is one where you have to program algorithms on a whiteboard to get a job in web dev.<p>And for THAT world,  it absolutely makes sense to study this material that you don&#x27;t use in your job,  but are being judged on.","time":1493394385,"type":"comment"},{"by":"spapas82","id":14220237,"kids":[{"by":"sdflkd","id":14222780,"parent":14220237,"text":"Can you retire on respect? :)","time":1493411163,"type":"comment"}],"parent":14219500,"text":"For me, preparing for an interview for weeks (or maybe months, I&#x27;ve even heard of interview preparatory courses) by reading exam-like stuff that won&#x27;t have any effect to your job but are interview preparation only is an insult to my personality.

The box had come from Shenzhen, China.  Curious I cut open the outside box.<p>Immediately I saw that the NAS they sent inside had been opened, and had been re-tapped shut -- and poorly, there was a clear bulge on top of the box.  My heart sank a bit... but I figured, &quot;Well, let&#x27;s see -- maybe it was a return or something... can&#x27;t hurt to open it again since it&#x27;s already been opened.&quot;<p>Inside the NAS box, all the manuals are in Chinese... and seem like they are just photocopies of the originals.  The NAS was not in the original packaging, but rather elaborate bubble wrap.  And there&#x27;s a China to US power adapter to the cord.<p>I&#x27;m curious if it would even turn on, so I plug in the NAS... It boots!  But not in English.  I&#x27;m thinking, &quot;What did I just buy?!&quot;  But I can sort of read some of the messages and it seems like instead of 4x2GB drives, it came with 4x4GB drives.  Interesting.<p>It&#x27;s late so I leave it initializing the drives (I think that&#x27;s what it was doing anyway) and go to bed.  Next morning I wake up, and it&#x27;s still initializing the drives.  Fuck it... time to call tech support and get my money back.  The little light kept blinking yellow, but I couldn&#x27;t read anything.<p>I email Amazon to initiate the return process, then go to work.  I leave the NAS running -- honestly just sort of forgot about it.  Got pulled into a business trip that day, so it was about 4 days until I got back to focus on the project again.  When I got home the little yellow light on the NAS was still blinking, and I thought it was weird that I hadn&#x27;t gotten an email from the seller with return instructions.<p>I email Amazon to tell them I hadn&#x27;t heard anything back from the seller, and since I had to wait anyway, decided to call tech support.  Cringe.<p>The thing was, the NAS was still doing something.  The drives were still spinning... but after 4 days... I figured it wasn&#x27;t doing anything good.  But I didn&#x27;t unplug it.  I read the serial number to the guy in tech support.  Pause... &quot;Can you read me the serial number again?&quot;  I do... longer pause.  &quot;Can you read me the serial number one more time?&quot;  I do...  Pause...  &quot;Please hold, Sir.&quot;<p>&quot;Sir, where did you get this NAS?&quot;  I&#x27;d been transferred to someone up the food chain who told me that the device I had wasn&#x27;t a valid serial number -- that the number I gave was for a model that hadn&#x27;t been released yet.  Super weird conversation, they took all my details, Amazon order number, and told me they would call me back.<p>Really late, like 2 AM that night, I got an email from the seller.  It just said, &quot;What wrong?&quot;<p>So I write back, and my phone signature had my cell phone number on it.  I get a call.  At like 3 AM.  The guy is polite, but his English isn&#x27;t great.  He tells me to just unplug the NAS, and plug it back in again -- then walks me through how to install the English interface.  We&#x27;re chatting for like 2 hours.  He&#x27;s crazy knowledgeable.  We get everything set up, but I have no idea what all I just put on the device... most of the links he had been emailing me throughout the process were just IP addresses and paths.  But they seem legit... and there wasn&#x27;t anything on the NAS yet so I didn&#x27;t mind running strange updates on it.<p>He says the yellow light will blink for 4 hours 24 minutes.  (I don&#x27;t remember the exact number, but the point was it was an exact number.)  He says to email him, not Amazon -- he&#x27;s very clear about that -- if I need help after.  He&#x27;s a friendly guy, I liked how helpful he was.<p>I go back to sleep for a few hours, do some yard work when I wake up, forget about the NAS, but when I checked later... some point after 4 hours 24 minutes... it&#x27;s all green and working fine.  And it&#x27;s got twice the space than I paid for.  And it&#x27;s all in English.  Only thing was... when I hit the &quot;check for updates&quot; option it just spun and nothing happened.  But everything else seemed perfect.<p>So I&#x27;m on the fence... I have this clearly not authentic NAS from some random guy in China... that the manufacturer says it&#x27;s not supposed to exist... but it&#x27;s 100% bigger than what I thought I paid for...<p>That night I got an email from the seller, and you can tell he&#x27;s sad.  &quot;I tried to help you, why did you tell Amazon it was a fake?  It not a fake.&quot;  I wrote back that I think that was from before he and I spoke, I had called the manufacturer&#x27;s tech support to get the issue fixed and they told me the serial number wasn&#x27;t real, but that it&#x27;s working fine for me now.<p>He was writing back instantly, &quot;It not a fake, you want a refund?  I give you refund, but please don&#x27;t complain to Amazon about me, I sell good stuff.&quot; Right away I see an email from Amazon telling me that the seller had given me a 100% refund.  He even refunded shipping costs.<p>I felt awful.  Here&#x27;s this guy who spent 2 hours on the phone with me, probably spent a lot on an international call, and the manufacturer contacted Amazon about the order and came down on him for selling counterfeits.  Probably scared him or told him he wouldn&#x27;t be able to sell on Amazon any more if it was a fake... who knows.<p>I write back, &quot;Thanks for the refund, where do I send the NAS?  I will pay for shipping.  I didn&#x27;t mean to get you in trouble.&quot;<p>He writes back, &quot;I&#x27;m sorry.  It&#x27;s not a fake.  Please don&#x27;t be mad at me.&quot;<p>The case was marked as resolved at Amazon, the guy told me I didn&#x27;t have to return the NAS, and I never heard back from the manufacturer.  Free NAS!  But a little guilt because I didn&#x27;t pay this guy for it, or for his time... and he stopped responding to my emails after that.  I offered to send it back to him two more times.<p>About a year later I logged in to the interface, realized the auto-update feature was working fine.  Updated the bios and firmware.  I think that was 5-6 years ago now -- it&#x27;s been running great.<p>I had raved about the quality of the NAS to a friend, who bought the same model about 6 months after I did... but his died a few months ago... when we took it apart to switch out the drives we realized it had totally different drives and cables, and even the logic board seemed different from the one that mine had.  Sure hardware changes, but... his seemed more legit and polished inside than mine.  Mine has a few spots inside that just look glue-gunned in place.

I thought this might be Tindie at one point but that doesn&#x27;t seem to be their focus at this stage.)<p>2) An infrastructure&#x2F;raw materials market for the craft people. I&#x27;ve seen this with people who do this sort of custom work that finding suppliers is a huge issue and qualifying them and working with them.<p>3) Tooling and engineering services, where each craftsperson requires a specific set of tools which are by definition low volume but also high tolerance precision kit. My Dad&#x27;s engraving setup for example was put together with &quot;the&quot; engraving vice, and &quot;the&quot; compressor, and &quot;the&quot; engraving tool and bits. The company that makes all of the tooling is facilitated by an engravers guild which has a large number of members which provides an economical place for the tool manufacturer to serve, but is it possible to create a business that can make bespoke tools at a price that allows the person purchasing them to recover the costs in a reasonable amount of time?<p>Fundamentally, I am asking whether it is possible to build a &quot;factory&quot; that is not so specialized that it could supply the needs of a variety of users in different activities. Could we build such a facility in a &#x27;small town&#x27; and be able to staff it? Or put another way, what is the smallest unit of economic self sufficiency given a global shipping market.<p>I&#x27;m having a hard time expressing this clearly but consider the following analogy&#x2F;question. Let&#x27;s say you have a town, SmallVille, that has a functional economy because there is a car parts factory that employs 1&#x2F;3 of the working aged people. Their salaries go, in part, to shopping for groceries, haircuts, meals out, movies, etc, which employs a second third of the working aged people, and those businesses and the local governance employs the remaining third. Its a nice small town, everyone has a job, and life is good.<p>Now historically, we&#x27;ve seen that car parts factory close because car parts could be made cheaper elsewhere and the entire economy of the town collapses as you get 1&#x2F;3 of the population out of work and so competeing with the remaining 2&#x2F;3rds for their jobs, and without that money coming in the number of services businesses that are needed goes down so there are actually fewer of the remaining jobs available, which further crushes the life out of the town.<p>Basically without that parts plant feeding money into the town in exchange for car parts the town fails. So can we replace that car parts factory with a factory that can reasonably serve a much wider variety of needs?

And yes, I know this hasn&#x27;t been accomplished before (hence the &#x27;it may be impossible&#x27;) and yes I&#x27;ve dealt with trying to get two manufacturers building the same part such that you couldn&#x27;t tell which factory made the part when you were assembling systems (in that case it was front panels for NetApp filers but I&#x27;m sure there are similar stories from anyone who has built product) it is really really hard and maybe not possible.

The number of files it can handle at once varies a bit, but it can&#x27;t reliably do a million at once. The actual size of the files isn&#x27;t much of a factor.<p>I would recommend moving those files back out of your local Drive folder and starting the app. Once it has settled, move them in a little at a time, preferably fewer than 100k at once, waiting for the sync to complete before the next batch. The limitation is not on the number of files synced, but the number of files actively syncing.<p>If you later need to sync all these files down to another Windows machine, you will probably need to use the Selective Sync option to only sync down a few folders at a time, adding more later.<p>If you happen to have a Mac available to do these uploads, this limitation should not exist in the Mac version of the client.","time":1493319747,"type":"comment"},{"by":"mcgrath_sh","id":14213735,"kids":[{"by":"glenneroo","id":14214365,"kids":[{"by":"kalleboo","id":14217059,"parent":14214365,"text":"I can&#x27;t imagine having the patience to wait 2 years(!!) to upload everything.

I upgraded to a paid plan so I&#x27;d have no storage limits. But the moment I tried to back some large folders, I noticed the upload speeds were capped, and the native client kept crashing. I&#x27;d leave it on overnight, just to see it not running in the morning. 100 GB of files is a trivial amount these days, and it&#x27;s impossible to manage on Drive. And selective sync would attempt to upload the folder before it deletes it locally, so was useless. I couldn&#x27;t just select which folders to upload first, even though I was there trying it due to Drive&#x27;s own inability to upload large amounts of files.<p>Then there are all the sync issues. I had setup 5 or 6 computers to sync files, which is the main use case Drive is sold on. Yet, I&#x27;d notice (1) and (2) and (3) duplicate versions of the same file, and at one point I had a folder with (79).<p>So I&#x27;d have to dig through partially synced folders and duplicates just to figure out what to sync first, then sort through computers to see if Drive was actually running. Then remove large folders to outside of Drive, and drop them in in batches just so Drive wouldn&#x27;t choke itself.<p>I also had an issue with file name length. I had copied a folder of saved web pages from Dropbox. I&#x27;d noticed all the directories were empty in Drive. Turns out, the folder names were too long. I understand the existence of technical constraints, but if I can&#x27;t move files from Dropbox just by copying them, Drive needs to modify it&#x27;s feature set.<p>Insync is the only reason I still have Drive. It doesn&#x27;t crash, and it doesn&#x27;t have sync duplication issues. But again, there is some API rate limit that causes it to halt. Drive is simply incapable of handling large amounts of files. I wish they&#x27;d just say that.<p>So I am back on Dropbox because I have no other options. And it just works.

And yet, this is not what should happen all.  It is too simple, and it hides the real problem.<p>People need to have <i>critical thinking skills</i>, about <i>everything</i>.  “How could this be misleading?” is a valuable question to be able to ask in life, whether it is about news or the latest TV commercial or something else.  It is certainly useful in capitalist systems; for instance, when being sold something and an advertisement boasts “up to 40%!”, that kind of verbiage should <i>always</i> raise questions like: “how often will this be 0% or even negative, values which are also in that range?”.  This kind of thing is used very frequently in advertising alone but certainly in news and even in discussions with other people.  Wording is crucial, comprehension is crucial.  If you ever suspect you do not really understand what you see, you need to take it as a cue to educate yourself.<p>Echo chambers, or silos or whatever you want to call them, should also be recognized.  Skills need to be practiced, and you cannot practice critical thinking if you are surrounded by agreement all the time.  This can be a hard sell because you can certainly feel a lot <i>happier</i> when not encountering things that challenge your views but that is not how an intellectual discussion works; you need to at least accept the <i>possibility</i> that even your long-held beliefs are not <i>exactly</i> right.<p>It is dangerous for suppression tools to exist for news or anything else because, like so many things in security technology, something that’s <i>possible</i> to do can eventually be abused by <i>anyone</i>.  Claims that “only the good guys will be able to use this” are not relevant to the discussion.  At some point in this case, there <i>will</i> be someone capable of masking something that he or she <i>personally</i> does not like, and “propaganda” will have nothing to do with the mechanism by which the material is hidden.<p>In any scientific endeavor, you can never universally support results; you always need to know <i>what was considered</i> to understand if the results make sense <i>within those parameters</i>.  And this applies to any source of information.  Even in heated political discussions, it is <i>way</i> easier to understand why somebody may hold a view that you consider strange if you can figure out exactly what they have and haven’t heard about.","time":1493499637,"type":"comment"},{"by":"Hydraulix989","id":14229010,"kids":[{"by":"dragonwriter","id":14229058,"kids":[{"by":"Hydraulix989","id":14229072,"kids":[{"by":"sprafa","id":14231121,"kids":[{"by":"Hydraulix989","id":14233097,"parent":14231121,"text":"Well, I just so happen to think undermining the American democratic process by calling into question the legitimacy of the (undesired) election results is pretty serious.<p>This has happened time and time again anytime we somehow end up electing a Republican...","time":1493577190,"type":"comment"}],"parent":14229072,"text":"The left&#x27;s version of WMDs?

It&#x27;s that bad.<p>Some paraphrased&#x2F;elided highlights from the article:<p>--<p>Practicality as a secure mail device:<p>- The TL;DR of the &quot;unbreakable security&quot; is that the device sends TLS-encrypted email on another nomx device listening on port 26... <i>USING THE DEFAULT &quot;snakeoil&quot; Postfix TLS CERTIFICATES.</i><p>- <i>The device sends from port 25.</i> Or rather, it tries to - it worked for the post author, but I can personally say this would not work for me; my ISP blocks port everything outgoing on port 25.<p>- <i>The device tries to relay mail from a residential IP.</i> Predictably, all commercial email systems shut this down the moment they see it. Hotmail has the decency to actually kick the email back; other providers seem to just silently drop it.<p>- <i>The device will immediately put your IP on DNS blacklists because you are sending mail that looks 100% like spam.</i> These blacklists are used by a variety of online services so this is likely to catch up with you in a big way eventually (one thing I just wondered is whether Google checks your IP this way when deciding how complicated to make the captchas it sends you).<p>- When you set up a link to another nomx device (it calls this a &quot;handshake&quot;), you have to do it by IP address. There is no mechanism to autoupdate the remote IP (I do acknowledge such a system would be mildly nontrivial to put together, but I think this is already at the &quot;doing it wrong&quot; stage and this type of solution is not what is needed here).<p>--<p>Security considerations:<p>- The default credentials are &quot;admin@example.com&quot; + &quot;password&quot; and there is no requirement to change this upon login.<p>- The device is so full of vulnerabilities it&#x27;s possible to pwn it by simply visiting an arbitrary malicious Web page (from any web site on the Internet) that scans your network to find the device - once that&#x27;s done the malicious page can fire off a series of form submissions (probably also doable via XHR) to gain a login cookie, <i>create a new admin user that will not be visible because the device is only capable of listing one admin</i>, and then...<p>- With the device pwned, it&#x27;s possible to take it over completely, create arbitrary incoming email addresses, and attempt to send mail from the device, from your IP. Your computer doesn&#x27;t even need to be on for this to work, obviously. I say <i>attempt to send mail</i> because most of it will be blocked, but you could easily take someone down by sending highly offensive mail to a provider that let the email through - bam, your IP is on file as having sent the email.<p>- Thunderbird required repeated manual verification of the device&#x27;s TLS certificate (something the device purports not to require!).<p>--<p>Software versions:<p>- Raspbian GNU&#x2F;Linux 7 (wheezy) - last updated 7th May 2015<p>- nginx version: nginx&#x2F;1.2.1 - released 5th June 2012<p>- PHP 5.4.45-0+deb7u5 - released 3rd September 2015<p>- OpenSSL 1.0.1t - released 3rd May 2016<p>- Dovecot 2.1.7 - released 29th May 2012<p>- Postfix 2.9.6 - released 4th February 2013<p>- MySQL Ver 14.14 Distrib 5.5.52 - released 6th September 2016<p>The author received no response to his requests for updated versions of the software.<p>The device also has no autoupdate mechanism, and there is also no mention of such a mechanism being in development.<p>--<p>Other thoughts:<p>- The device uses GoDaddy for dynamic DNS.

Working on multiple projects that need different versions of a dependency, particularly when your also working on that dependency, can be a pain still.

Massive achievement, but the gaps are visible.<p>The module system feels stale; a holdout of a system from different workflow times. Splitting stuff off into separate files for maintainability(including improving multi-dev workflows trying to reduce conflicts) creates some gross imports.<p>It feels like there is a reluctance to evolve the language itself; a lot of enhancements appear to be made via more magic metaprogramming and function usage. super(Cls, self).__init__() comes off as an artifact of this. Not really my cup of tea these days, but I can see how this is very subjective.<p>The propper way to handle generated members with pylint is supposedly a plugin; which almost no projects provide.<p>Type annotations are supposed to go a long way in 3.x, but the prevalence of metaprogramming and lack of tooling awareness has probably defeated more jedi than Darth Vader.<p>boto3 has no official async support even though lambda just released support for Python 3.6. Meanwhile the javascript sdk is shipping with TypeScript definitions and a new promise interface.<p>A lot of this is very subjective(other than perhaps the languishing of certain library areas) of course.

The reason I mention that it is the best example of a report summarising the case against climate change. It does talk about politics and whether evidence is circumstantial, the IPCC report does not - this does not mean I believe one report is objectively better than the other.<p>The level of scientific content is significantly less than the IPCC report, although I agree there is some and had I more time to review would certainly be interested to look in more detail. It is reactive to the IPCC report and at a first reading the IPCC report looks significantly more robust and extensive in its coverage. I am open to be convinced otherwise, but based on my (subjective) reading I still find the NIPCC to have a lower quality and depth of scientific reasoning than the IPCC.<p>Incidentally, the main reason I am dismissive about the petition is that accuracy in science is not the result of a popularity contest. All the scientists I know personally certainly have much more than a PhD, so I am sceptical about the qualifications of the petitioners here. Some no doubt are more qualified than me, however a petition is hardly the way to demonstrate their expertise! In any case I am surprised if there are more convincing reports that these have not been more thoroughly publicised.<p>As you say, it would be better for the NIPCC people to make their report apolitical, if the problem is really about the science. If it is about the politics then the strongest way to improve their case against climate change would be to improve the science on their side.<p>Regarding whether the science leads or the politics leads, it is clear to me that both are important. My response highlighted that some of the political problems that you speak about are evidence of likely flaws in the way that the science is done. However, I do not believe that these are fundamental issues. I believe more science rather than less science is the way forward. I totally acknowledge there are incentives on both sides (even if the science should prove to be completely wrong), however it is probably worth remembering that many climatologists are likely highly trained and employable even if climate research funding decreases.<p>If the science is correct, there is potentially a very big problem for the world. The eventual impact is potentially on the order of trillions of USD per year based on a couple of reports I&#x27;ve looked at (see <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Economic_impacts_of_climate_change#Aggregate_impacts\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Economic_impacts_of_climate_ch...</a>, <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.schroders.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;sysglobalassets&#x2F;digital&#x2F;us&#x2F;pdfs&#x2F;the-impact-of-climate-change.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.schroders.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;sysglobalassets&#x2F;digital&#x2F;us&#x2F;pdfs&#x2F;...</a> for examples). Now, again, these estimates could be wrong, and are referring to impacts far down the line, however if they are even remotely indicative, the IPCC budget (~60MM USD since 2001 according to <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnsnews.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-taxpayers-cover-nearly-half-cost-un-s-global-warming-panel\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnsnews.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-taxpayers-cover-nearl...</a>) and total US spending on climate change (of the order of 10B USD per year, according to <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gao.gov&#x2F;key_issues&#x2F;climate_change_funding_management&#x2F;issue_summary\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gao.gov&#x2F;key_issues&#x2F;climate_change_funding_managem...</a>) is not completely unreasonable.<p>Now even if you feel the science is suspect in parts, I assume you would not want to throw away all of it? It is clear that something is happening to the climate - lack of ice in the arctic being one example, but others such as death of corals in the Great Barrier Reef being another. We also have political choices on how much funding to give to research and economic reform. We live in a polluted world, and it appears very much in our interests to fund research into ways to mitigate climate change and reduce pollution.<p>I can see that debate on this can be productive, and I would prefer a more open debate than is currently possible. However, this does appear to me to be an area where we are probably underfunding rather than overfunding the scientific (and political!) debate. The consequences of climate change if it proves to be close to the scientific consensus are horrendous, and really one of the most critical issues facing the planet. The benefits of much of the mitigation strategies are large regardless of the science.","time":1493825095,"type":"comment"}],"parent":14241191,"text":"It&#x27;s interesting that you cite the NIPCC report, but then downplay it as merely political and circumstantial.

Why, then, do you dismiss it out-of-hand?<p>&gt; Now I don&#x27;t follow the political debate on whether the IPCC is biased by funding or some other supposed disincentives for scientists to report truthfully.<p>This is my entire point.  It is absolutely crucial.  You can ignore it if you want, but you are missing the full picture, and therefore cannot accurately assess the claims of both sides.<p>&gt; On the other hand I do see that there is less obvious evidence of political bias from reading the published reports.<p>I guess you meant &quot;the published IPCC reports.&quot;  I should think that, if any group wanted to push their political view under the guise of science, they would certainly take care to make their reports appear apolitical.  Making your judgment based solely on their own word would be like a judge asking a defendent, &quot;Did you do it?  No?  Okay, you&#x27;re free to go.&quot;  You have to corroborate outside evidence to make a reasonable judgment.<p>&gt; If someone wanted to understand the science it is fairly clear to me the IPCC report would be a much better starting point than the NIPCC report.<p>Again, the NIPCC report appears to explain much science as well, so it seems unreasonable for you to dismiss it while holding to the IPCC report.<p>&gt; There are significant financial incentives for people who stand to lose from climate change mitigation, for example in the oil industry, to fund people to investigate the case against climate change.<p>You&#x27;re right.  And by the same token, there are significant financial incentives for people who stand to lose from <i>not</i> engaging in mitigation.  These range from individual climatologists who have built their entire careers on studying the &quot;crisis&quot; of CAGW (if it were determined that there were no risk, what would their careers have accomplished?  What would they do next?), to corporations selling &quot;green&quot; energy products and carbon credits, to politicians who are using &quot;climate change&quot; to effect their political goals.  For example, Christine Figueres, UN executive of the Framework Convention on Climate Change, recently stated:<p><i>This is the first time in the history of mankind that we are setting ourselves the task of intentionally, within a defined period of time, to change the economic development model that has been reigning for at least 150 years, since the Industrial Revolution.  This is probably the most difficult task we have ever given ourselves, which is to intentionally transform the economic development model for the first time in human history.</i><p>Her stated goal here is not to mitigate the potential risks of catastrophic anthropogenic global warming (which might or might not necessarily entail changing the fundamental economic model of the world), but to transform the world&#x27;s economic model.  This is explicitly a <i>political goal</i>, not a scientific one.  The cart (politics) is leading the horse (science).<p>&gt; I would expect if the scientific case was highly suspect as you&#x27;d say that people would have funded equally convincing scientific reports on the other side.  The fact that I haven&#x27;t been able to find such reports suggests to me that there is not a convincing case against the science to be made.<p>This depends entirely on how much effort you have put into finding them and your criteria for &quot;equally convincing.&quot;  In fact, many scientists <i>have</i> found such convincing reports--as you yourself noted, at least 9,000 PhD-holding scientists, and about 21,000 non-PhD-holding scientists, who, by your own admission, are more qualified to judge than you.

This seem like a smaller version of an open office. Everyone has someone in their field of view, plus there&#x27;s a TV and large glass windows with couches directly outside of them. That seem like a great way to get a little bit distracted all the time. Three people in one office is usually much worse than two people in a smaller office. Since if one person does something distracting, they are distracting the other two people. And when two people want to talk about something they are distracting the third person.<p>What the author describes seem more like &quot;not having to go to meetings&quot; or &quot;not being bothered by management&quot; than actually being able to work undisturbed for a predictable period of time.","time":1493390900,"type":"comment"}],"parent":14210181,"text":"I like the concept of the shared 3-person offices. I think that&#x27;s a good size. As someone who works professionally designing offices (as an engineer, but working with architects and interior designers) let me bring up a few practical considerations.<p>1. Accessibility. Offices have to comply with the Americans with Disabilities act. This includes requirements determining how wide passageways have to be. So having a wall immediately in front of a door as you enter a room is problematic. You  need enough space between the wall and the door for a person in a wheelchair to enter and turn around. This creates a lot of wasted space compared to not having the wall there. Likewise the study corrals in the quite space room are way too close together, the bathroom doesn&#x27;t have a handicapped stall, if you have showers, one or more of the shower stalls will also need to be accessible.<p>2. I&#x27;m not sure how well the unisex bathroom would fly. There are code requirements for number of toilets &#x2F; urinals required based on occupancy. Usually it ends up cheaper to separate the bathrooms since some of the requirements for men can be addressed with urinals, which are going to be cheaper.<p>3. There&#x27;s a reason most offices don&#x27;t have a stove. Once you put a stove in a pantry it becomes a kitchen - a commercial kitchen. This brings a host of other requirements for automatic fire suppression over the stove. Exhaust hoods over the range. Makeup air to replace the air pushed out by the range hood. Grease traps, all sorts of things. Not that it can&#x27;t be done, it&#x27;s just expensive and most companies will not pay for it.<p>4. Space requirements - the design is very space inefficient. While it&#x27;s nice to have a big room shared by 3 people, it&#x27;s going to cost a lot in terms of rent. Offices are leased in terms of $&#x2F;sf. Every extra square foot that isn&#x27;t being used is costing you money. The main reason companies like open offices is that they can cram a lot of people into a minimum amount of space. This would be really nice and a wonderful place to work, but it will cost a fortune.","time":1493384417,"type":"comment"},{"by":"cies","id":14217840,"kids":[{"by":"cableshaft","id":14222079,"parent":14217840,"text":"E-ink monitors can&#x27;t come soon enough.

Let me dampen that immediately, fire regulations and other rules probably state that you cannot have an open flame or other heating devices outside of a very small selection or well-controlled items.

Honestly, what you really need is a male restroom that&#x27;s about 5 times the size of the female restroom.  Again, that won&#x27;t fly politically, but practically it makes sense because there&#x27;s so few women in software.  Better yet is to just ditch the shared bathrooms altogether: they&#x27;re nasty and smelly, and it&#x27;s inhuman to have to sit on the pot next to someone with only a crappy divider which doesn&#x27;t even go to the floor so you can see their feet and their pants around their ankles.  You also have to worry about Idahoans playing footsie with you in there.  Whoever came up with this idea has serious mental issues, and somehow it&#x27;s the norm almost everywhere.  Instead, just have separate 1-person unisex bathrooms, and put little showers in at least 2 of them for the cyclists.<p>The walled offices with giant windows: these windows are much too large on the inside.  The whole reason for a walled office is to have privacy, and you&#x27;re taking it away with those windows.  Also, you&#x27;re distracting the people sitting inside because they&#x27;ll see all the people walking by their office, since that office will most likely open into a high-traffic corridor.  Make the windows much smaller, maybe enough to see the top of the head of someone sitting inside and that&#x27;s about it.  Or just get rid of them altogether, or maybe have frosted glass.  Windows on the other side are nice, but there&#x27;s only so much space along the outside wall of the building, so who gets to sit here?

They have the oft-maligned[0] open-office layout, which coming from a work-at-home coding job, should have been <i>really</i> painful.  Their approach, however, has worked out really well for me for a few reasons:<p>0&#x2F; Staff understands the need for concentration when coding.  <i>Almost</i> everyone here is a software developer, so we&#x27;re all respectful of one another.  I was told on <i>day one</i> that if someone has headphones in, it&#x27;s best to instant message them rather than walk up because there&#x27;s an unwritten rule that &quot;headphones&quot; means &quot;I&#x27;m concentrating&quot;.  I actually wonder how many folks have headphones in with nothing on -- I use my active noise-cancelling cans regularly with nothing but the noise cancelling turned on because it gives solid, simulating, silence.  But the thing of it is, the place isn&#x27;t loud or overly distracting.<p>1&#x2F; There are a number of meeting rooms and couches throughout the office, located in quiet places, with no &quot;rules&quot; about use other than that scheduled meetings win over impromptu for meeting rooms.  People are encouraged to work wherever they&#x27;re comfortable and I prefer to sit on a couch with my feet up since while I was working at home I tended to work on my couch in the living room or in my bed rather than in my office[1].  The couches are placed in areas that are offset from the general office area, so they&#x27;re quieter, as well.  I simply don&#x27;t sit at my assigned desk and nobody cares (really, it&#x27;s encouraged).  My desk is also located on a side of the office where lights are turned off because those who sit over there prefer it[1].<p>2&#x2F; They have a number of other alternative workstations set-up, like unassigned standing desks (with bar-stools for those who want to sit at a standing desk...).  This allows me to switch things up when I&#x27;m in a rut and need an environment change to inspire me.<p>I thought it was going to be a lot more painful to adjust from working at home to working in an open-office environment.  I&#x27;m finding I like it quite a bit, though.  At the end of the day most companies have two choices for office layout -- open or cube farm.  The reason is that cubicle walls are considered furniture under tax code, whereas offices are classified differently.  This makes cube-walls far more cost effective than &quot;real walls&quot; due to the increased time that it takes for the latter to be allowed to be written off.  Having done the cramped cube-farm arrangement, I&#x27;ll take open.  Cubicles are the worst of both worlds -- they feel like working in a (small) closet, and when laid out the way they typically are, they destroy ones ability to navigate an office, block natural light and make a place feel more prison-like.  Open offices kill privacy and negatively affect concentration but allow light to flow and make the office feel big and ... open ... which I am finding I like quite a bit.  Plus, it&#x27;s a lot easier to ride the one-wheel skateboards around the office when there&#x27;s fewer obstructions.<p>[0] Oft-maligned by me, specifically.  I wrote regularly about my hatred of this kind of office but now having spent a few months working in one, I am enjoying it quite a bit provided a few features are present.<p>[1] I casually mentioned my dislike for the darker side of the office to one of the company founders who introduced himself while I was working on the couch in the kitchen.  Before I could get the sentence out was told &quot;Oh, just move your desk!&quot;.  I haven&#x27;t done so because I have no need.  Sometimes I want to work in the dark (it&#x27;s not actually &quot;dark&quot;, it&#x27;s just not lit by interior lighting -- our office is pretty bright due to the wealth of windows and natural light during the day), so I troll back there when I feel like it.  Because I can work in so many different places in the office, it&#x27;s irrelevant where my desk is.","time":1493393278,"type":"comment"},{"dead":true,"deleted":true,"id":14213326,"parent":14210181,"time":1493314800,"type":"comment"},{"by":"preordained","id":14216862,"kids":[{"by":"gitpusher","id":14216885,"parent":14216862,"text":"¯\\_(ツ)_&#x2F;¯ One can only evaluate their own environment and try to improve it.
