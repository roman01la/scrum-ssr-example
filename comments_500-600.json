Scales to millions of messages instantaneously, no need to spin up and spin down the capacity&#x2F;shards (like as in Kinesis), exposes RESTful interface for ingesting messages from anywhere (web&#x2F;mobile ... ). If you want a high-performance interface, you get gRPC as well. With RESTful interface to consuming messages, you can connect PubSub to anything you want or trigger Cloud Functions &#x2F; write to storage &#x2F; ingest to Stackdriver (Monitoring system) using managed services.<p>Querying Data: Big Query. No need to spin up a single server. Just write your query in SQL and watch the magic of a thousand servers being spun up to serve the query in a fraction of second and process a petabyte of data in a couple of minutes. btw ... you can ingest data into Big Query in real-time and analyze results within in seconds.<p>Process Data using Dataflow: For workflows that are more complex than SQL queries to ones that need to be running continuously on streaming data. Dataflow is the serverless version of Spark. No more running our of memory errors, much fewer hassles with hotkeys, no more manual performance tuning of buffers, no more cleaning up log folders. If you are using Spark, but have not tried Dataflow, you are missing some serious magic.<p>Google Cloud ML for Machine Learning: Cloud ML is a hosted solution for running TensorFlow jobs. No more manual hyperparameter optimization, no more spinning up GPUs, no more scaling up the cluster size. It&#x27;s all taken care for you.<p>Container Engine: Hosted version of Kubernetes. I am sure, everyone is aware of what K8 is and its capabilities.<p>I am from a Data &#x2F; Analytics &#x2F; ML background. The above was my reality of Serverless since 2015.

Charging $100 yearly developer fee was crazy. ESP since they were the incumbent and Google was charging a one-time fee of $49 if memory serves me.<p>2. MS decision not to allow sideloading of apps basically killed their chances outside US, UK, Germany... - places without cheap broadband.<p>Even IOS allowed for apps to be downloaded on a computer.<p>Many of my potential WP converts ran to Android for this very reason.<p>AFAIK, MS has issues increasing Store usage on Win10 in my country because store apps installation files can&#x27;t be stored offline.<p>3. API limitations - if the initial developer fee put a nail on the coffin. This was the hammer that drove it home. A lot of developers simply quit and focused on android. The few who persisted habitually wrote messages like, &quot;...feature cannot be done due to a limitation in the OS&quot;<p>4. Speed - if Bill was in charge, WP would be hale &amp; hearty right now. Ballmer and his people took their sweet time before adding new features - as if they were competing with resourceless startups or stagnant giants. Thousands of feature requests flooded Nokia forum, the ln user voice - only for a handful to be added a year and six months later. E.g. Notification area, file manager, folders, led notification, wifi direct<p>5. Apple worship - IMO WP was Microsoft&#x27;s first attempt to out-Apple Apple on design. Win8 was the second and Surface was the third.<p>They forgot to notice that Apple never copied blindly - copying the spirit of a design or feature -  Apple STOLE.<p>Since WP, win8..10 all that matters to Ms is looks and pays lip service usability &amp; productivity.<p>6. Nokia released too many phones with nonsensical, confusing naming. They released flagships with 2 year old processors. And randomly removed features available in low range phones from high&#x2F;mid range phones and vice versa.<p>7. Nokia att exclusives killed more sales than they would ever know.<p>8. Ms&#x2F;Nokia focused too much on the US market. In fact, Ms behaves as if only US market exists. Cortana spent more than a year as a US exclusive.<p>Till today, some Bing features are US only.<p>9. Marketing - MS simply didn&#x27;t market the OS. Nokia - a hardware partner did 100x more marketing than ever MS.<p>10. Selling the OS - selling the OS free for the first 2 years would have bought them many partners esp since Android was free.<p>11. Platform reboot - wp7, wp8, Wp8.1, wp10. Every reboot inflicted a deep wound on fans, OEMs and the OS.<p>This reboot issue plagues Skype as well. I remember at least 4 reboots of skype on WP.<p>12.

Note the phrase &quot;relative&quot;; this is not something that a couple kids from Stanford can disrupt, you need expensive lawyers and banking contacts. You can run all of that from your office in Mountain View though.<p>You&#x27;ll also need to comply with various &quot;know your customer&quot; regulations; the US government will not be happy if you wire money to O. Bin Laden, or anyone else on the OFAC watchlist. And even if you&#x27;re sending money to a &quot;gmail UK&quot; email address, you will need some way of proving that you&#x27;re not sending money to countries that have sanctions&#x2F;restrictions on capital flows like Iran and North Korea.<p>That&#x27;s the easy part. If you actually try to make a serious international play, then you&#x27;ll need a sizable team in each region that you want to do business in. The Eurozone is relatively easy to cover, but your regulatory requirements in South American countries will probably require one or two people per country (that&#x27;s to keep your bank relationships warm, and to keep up with all of the paperwork that&#x27;s required to operate a money transmitter business).<p>This is why Paypal charges merchant fees of 4.4% _plus forex fee_ to receive money from an arbitrary country in the world.

Eating creates noise and smell pollution. I don&#x27;t want to smell your tacos, and I don&#x27;t want to hear the scratching of a spoon in an empty joghurt cup.<p>It is also not the thought about hygienic implications. Lots of the food consumed at desks is finger food. I&#x27;ve grown up getting taught to wash hands before eating and to use knife and spoon. The thought that someone changes between food and operating the keyboard, a piece that has been proven to be dirtier than toilet seats, is unsettling.<p>No, it is the fact that the person sees eating as a mindless task that can be done _while working_ that bothers me most. As if it was filling up gas at the pump. No, eating to me has two dimensions that these cultureless creatures spurn: that food is, next to breathing and sleeping, one of the most important things that keep you alive. You liteeally are what you eat. Your body tells you very directly what it needs and how much. But you got to listen to it while you&#x27;re eating. It is already a series of sensations that require being mindful. Just think of the texture, smell, and taste of a leaf of basil. Of olive oil. Of fresh fish. Wonderful.<p>The other side is that eating is a social endeavour. It is an opportunity to bond and build empathy. It&#x27;s an opportunity to relax and get good ideas as a team. Also to exchange information. I would say those of our team that go out for lunch regularly are more successful than the ones who don&#x27;t.<p>So, I think eating at the desk while working is wrong in many dimensions.

Quite the opposite of FOSS. Now, if hobbyists or companies share their internal or throwaway code, they have to put a specific license on it. They might throw it on Sourceforge or Github but I still have no right to it without a license.

Configurator requires you to physically plug in each iPad in order to manage it, which is untenable for 300 iPads.  Profile Manager is a Rails 2.x piece of software that has only seen small updates and works sporadically.   When the Apple products didn&#x27;t work in our situation we choose a 3rd party vendor.  The results were much the same; sometimes it would work and push apps out, sometimes it would completely ignore your requests or only push out apps to some of the iPads.

You might start out thinking you&#x27;re only ever going to have one interface to a datastore, but the reality is that you always have at least two. Someone has the ability to go directly to the store itself and make changes. That&#x27;s life. Someone at some point in the lifetime of your app or company is going to go in and have to fix things by hand. If you have no schema and no constraints in the datastore itself, the odds of an error make things worse are far, far greater.<p>We all know that&#x27;s bad practice, but we all also know that sometimes you just have to do it for some reason. We also know that there will be times when someone is testing something on what they think is the local testing db but are actually connected to prod, and they do something experimental, and it screws things up. That&#x27;s also a terrible thing to let happen, but we all know that it does.<p>The second thing I&#x27;d like to point out that, much like sending email, any sufficiently useful application will, at some point, provide an API. And you&#x27;re going to have to re-implement the backend validation again for that.<p>So you know from the outset that if you are working on something you expect to be successful, you&#x27;re going to have 3 access points. You&#x27;re going to have to do the same work 3 times in 3 different places, unless you just decide to take the risk and use a db that doesn&#x27;t have schema or constraints--which is a big risk. Doesn&#x27;t make sense to me.<p>Finally, I&#x27;d like to add to this good post that it&#x27;s pretty easy to work in either direction with many ORMs. If you&#x27;re comfortable with DBs, you can write out your migration scripts and use the ORM to generate models from it. If you prefer to work with an ORM, you can write the model and manage the migrations in the ORM. Either way, there&#x27;s really not that much overhead compared to what you gain in safety and security and DRY.<p>I&#x27;m not a DRY nazi, and when I&#x27;m prototyping, I&#x27;ll repeat code anywhere I suspect a later iteration to diverge from the other instances of that code, and then refactor when I get closer to production. But when you&#x27;re talking about database structure, I don&#x27;t see how that can diverge, so it makes sense to me that you should never repeat yourself there. That&#x27;s just asking for trouble.<p>Do it once in the database, and do it right. Then all you have to do is trap database errors in your backend code and validate on the front end. That will be different for every interface, but it&#x27;s a lot simpler and cleaner and safer than enforcing schemata and constraints in every codebase that accesses the data store.","time":1493590207,"type":"comment"}],"parent":14232521,"text":"There&#x27;s a wide variety of reasons to want the schema in the database, and schemas are so valuable that even our good friends at Google decoded to add database level schemas to their massively distributed data stores.<p>The strongest reason is that the database will complain loudly if you want to make a change that breaks existing constraints. An application, no matter how simple, will probably change, and you don&#x27;t want to leave data out there that is unreadable and that will break your application&#x27;s expectations. The schema minimizes the chances of garbage historical data that have been, in my experience the plague of NoSQL-backed apps. Often you find people that end up writing ad hoc constraint checkers, creating a poor imitation of what a database that understands schemas does well.<p>Another big reason is that there&#x27;s rarely just one application, and the applications could (and very often should) be written in different languages. A schema at that point becomes a service which just happens to not use Json or Thrift, but a far more complicated, sturdier one. You could still argue that databases are too complicated to expose very widely, but I&#x27;d much rather have all my data sitting in the very schema-heavy redshift to do reporting than to rely on application logic, or use most business insight tools out there.<p>Also, let&#x27;s not forget that schemas let databases do a lot of complex operations rather cheaply, because they can have very optimized code of very specific shapes next to the data. In the cases where &#x27;first, I will take 50K rows out of the db and into my application&#x27; is just not acceptable, you have to let the DB do the work. In those cases, the interface to use a windowing function in a SQL database is IMO far more convenient than having to go into the classic remote map reduce function in erlang.<p>I think there were plenty of gains from the NoSQL movement, especially as far as to start writing database where high availability and horizontally scalable loads are concerned.

With a blog, one simply begins to write blog posts.  There is no other approach to take, as you must before anything else establish your credibility as a writer within a domain of knowledge.<p>A news site is a far different proposal.

One frequently sees, out in the boonies of the not-directly-for-profit internet, knowledgable and useful summaries and introductions of content hosted elsewhere.  Fleshed out more thoroughly with a contextualization of what something means, how and why it matters, and what it should lead the reader to anticipate, such material could facilitate reader access to expert opinion and information that would otherwise be beyond them.<p>As another example, editorial oversight, in particular, is in a state of near-crisis, everywhere.

This isn&#x27;t even a question. The answer is yes. The ubiquitous &#x27;clean, modern, &quot;Tech is neat! :D Business and advertising! :D Everything is safe! :D&quot; aesthetic&#x27; is wrong. It&#x27;s a monolithic lie, and we all know it.<p>The biggest contributing factor to the decline of the cyberpunk aesthetic in the 80&#x27;s-90&#x27;s was how quickly it became realism. If you read a William Gibson novel now, it would be like reading William Faulkner in the 1800&#x27;s.<p>(I know Faulkner didn&#x27;t publish in the 1800&#x27;s. don&#x27;t go there, this is my reply and that means I decide how time works here.)<p>The implications of the use of the advanced tools we build on the individual, and the species as a whole, is rarely considered with the gravity it deserves, at least by the vast majority of end users, I believe, in large part, because capitalism is predatory, and subsequently the tools it uses to accomplish it&#x27;s end must be uniformly masked, behind a layer of safe aesthetics. A revival of the cyberpunk aesthetic in general, which paints technology as dangerous, empowering, and hints that the deeper into the technical details you get, the more empowered you become, would be a welcome return to realism from the magazine glossy, UI&#x2F;UX of modern services. I mean seriously, this &quot;Mumblecore&quot; jargon and friendly faces on services which, let&#x27;s be frank here, are simply the injections of profit and information siphoning mechanisms (the successful ones anyway) into monetary transactions for goods and services, and exchanges of information, between people, which already existed, in exchange for a razor-thin layer of convenience, and a gross distortion to their psychological faculties for perceiving value, to the end of contributing to the centralization of money, thus access to resources, and data, thus the ability to derive information, into the hands of a few, and creating (I&#x27;m trying my best to tone down the hyperbole here) impermeable veil of branding, that obfuscates as completely as possible, what anything actually is, or does.<p>(Don&#x27;t go there. It&#x27;s my reply, that means I can nest as many clauses in a statement as I want.)<p>If your blog even piques someone&#x27;s curiosity, or contributes peripherally to a compulsion to dig deeper into how the layers of complex systems underlying the mechanisms we use to interact with the world now work, it was worth every minute you spent on it up to that point. Seriously, do it.<p>Speaking from personal experience, if you had shown me an ad for a &quot;coding bootcamp&quot; when I was 10, I would have chosen.. literally anything else to get into. Fortunately, I got my hands on a copies &quot;Hell: A Cyberpunk Thriller&quot;, and &quot;Shadowrun&quot; instead. The sentiment of that art, the feeling of those ideas, with regards to technology, has kept my interest alive through day after day of questioning whether or not this specific impending bout of &#x27;meeting business requirements&#x27; in which I am about to engage means I am a terrible person.<p>Just do it dude.
