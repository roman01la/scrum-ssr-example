Imagine if the fruit picking machine gets to be reasonably aware of what fruits are ripe in the orchard at a given moment in time and is able to optimally pick fruit for a given customer, e.g. a sandwich bar chain may want ready to eat fruit whereas the supermarket may want something that ripens at home. A reasonable AI system could be trained to do a better job of reading the &#x27;ripe&#x27; signals of fruit and even &#x27;know&#x27; that given fruit since it was just a bud on a flower. Waste could be cut to a minimum if the system was aware of apples ready to go bad or drop to the floor.<p>As well as picking there is also the matter of grading the crop, getting it clean and so on. There is no reason why this machine can&#x27;t do all of that at source, so the apple gets washed, blown spotlessly dry with a Dyson style dryer and then instantly sorted&#x2F;graded and packed into some 100% nitrogen packet of some sort, sent to the distribution centre and on the shelves for lunch the next day.<p>Hopefully our new robotic overlords in the fields will work from above. Instead of heavy tractors, plant and people on the ground you could have some lighter weight equipment strung out from above, a mesh of wires held up by some massive wind turbine towers, to which the fruit picking machines might traverse.<p>McCain Chips are made with robots on the production line that pick out any defects, again, our fruit picking machines could do this and grade any cleaned produce as catering grade, nonetheless prepared clean and packed in nitrogen to prevent any further degradation. A whole new world of better product and time to market might be possible by handing over the fruit picking bit to the robots. Apples could even be picked when they got to a &#x27;perfect size&#x2F;weight&#x27; and not just graded that way, trees could be picked in such a way that all the fruit attains this &#x27;ideal&#x27; which is optimal given inputs.<p>Such a system would work 24&#x2F;7 in all seasons, tending the crop one way or another on a large estate, with some of its robotic arms going places at all times. You would need a team of maintenance and other support roles to keep things operational, all requiring a different skill set to the pickers of today. Their wages would be higher and spent in the local community rather than sent out of the country.<p>Orchards need not be so regimented for machines in this brave new world, orchards could have a mix of trees of all shapes and sizes, with different land use below, open to people and a proper &#x27;forest floor&#x27; for small furry animals. Fruit in such areas could be expected to be part eaten by bugs but our robot overlords could also be experts at picking the bugs out to produce perfectly good fruit for pies and juices.<p>Rejecting our soon-to-be robot fruit picking machines is like rejecting the horse drawn plough as it might put the humans that pull ploughs out of business.","time":1493534131,"type":"comment"}],"id":14230078,"score":45,"url":"http://www.seattletimes.com/business/agriculture/a-robot-that-picks-apples-washington-states-orchards-could-see-a-game-changer/","by":"e15ctr0n"},"14229820":{"time":1493518074,"type":"story","descendants":68,"title":"Hacker Leaks Episodes from Netflix Show and Threatens Other Networks","kids":[{"by":"jtchang","id":14230567,"kids":[{"by":"rorykoehler","id":14231009,"kids":[{"by":"gregmac","id":14233153,"parent":14231009,"text":"I doubt anyone was waiting to sign up to get non-first season of a single show, and now wouldn&#x27;t sign up.

Between this and modern manufacturing techniques, we see a glimpse of a future where socialists, centralists and anarchists all see a world resembling more of what they want, with regional control and generation of power resources and control over economics, but a framework left in place for a top down government to govern things that are advantageous overall (central planning for scarce resources &amp; conservation, rights and health care, etc).<p>Resistance to the topic on the grounds that Kyoto is bad is over-applied to all attempts to grapple with climate change, even when they actually have huge positive effects only tangentially related.","time":1493563797,"type":"comment"},{"by":"digsmahler","id":14231928,"kids":[{"by":"melling","id":14231992,"parent":14231928,"text":"I doubt it, at least from an economist&#x27;s point of view.

There are algorithms that can do what you call &quot;manual reconstruction&quot; in a more or less automated way. Of course, as with everything that is automated, there are edge cases where it doesn&#x27;t work correctly, but it&#x27;ll save you a lot of time.<p>What has been discussed here and in the OC, is mostly header-footer carving, but file-structure-based carving has been around for a long time already (I think Foremost included it in 2005&#x2F;2006, and PhotoRec supports it for <i>some</i> formats). Using the file command (*NIX) or TRiD to find the headers is a bit of a hack, and useful only if you want to sit a long time with dd (or an equivalent tool) and direct yourself the carving process.<p>As for the fragmentation issue, there used to be around a great program called &quot;Adroit Photo Forensic&quot; which implemented the amazing SmartCarving(TM) approach (academically known as graph-theoretic-carving) in which the disk is scanned, pools of segments by file format are populated, and then a graph is constructed and analyzed with a Dijkstra&#x27;s shortest-path variant which works on multiple paths from multiple starts-to-ends. Very interesting, though a bit computationally expensive. Plus you need an extremely precise similarity metric between the segments, which was actually the weak-spot for this. However, it seems as if the Adroit product has died (I can only find mirrors now which host old versions of it), and as it was a try-and-buy program I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;d be able to use it now.<p>Thing is, there are easier ways to handle fragmentation. For example, PhotoRec itself lets you pass an agressive validation step, to discard most of the &quot;probably wrong&quot; recovered files, and then dump the remaining to an alternative disk image, on which you can try carving again. Of course, this iterative process takes time, but it can work, and of course it can be automated (and thus, saving you from manual intervention).<p>While my work has taken me away from it, I never quite understood why the digital forensics community &quot;forgot&quot; about file carving, or disregarded it as an important problem -- it seems as if there are still the same issues around as when I worked on it, while having less tools available.<p>As for the SeqBox format, more than an alternative to this tools, I find it as an interesting complement to them.","time":1493563282,"type":"comment"}],"parent":14230159,"text":"I would say rather common.<p>The whole issue is that file carving (once filesystem structures are destroyed) works fine with contiguous data but it doesn&#x27;t work (or it works only very partially, and depending on a number of factors) with any fragmented data.<p>But I will give you a common enough example, that I have seen happen many times.<p>The user wants to format a USB stick, but by mistake he&#x2F;she selects a data volume instead.<p>Two possibilities (under Windows later than XP):<p>1) user chose NOT the &quot;&#x2F;q&quot; (cli) or &quot;quick&quot; (GUI) format, all data is lost forever as starting from Vista if a &quot;full&quot; format is cosen the whole volume will be overwritten with 00&#x27;s<p>2) user chose to &quot;quick&quot; format, only the filesystem structures are recreated (blank) and - given that the volume was originally formatted on the same OS - they will be exactly where previous filesystem structure were, thus cleanly replacing them.<p>In this latter situation all files are still there, what is lost is where they are, the address info for a contiguous file is two pieces of data, where it begins and how big in size it is, there are a number of programs that can &quot;recognize&quot; a file (or its beginning) by its &quot;signature&quot; (usually a header, but sometimes a combination of header and footer), among them the excellent TriD tool by the same Author Marco Pontello, and a large number of file formats do include some info on the filesize, and there are slightly more sophisticated programs that can usually recognize if data belongs to a given filetype.<p>The address info of a fragmented data is as many starting points and as many extensions as the fragments, and since a fragment - bar the first one - have no headers it is extremely difficult to find all the fragments of a file (and knowing to which file a fragment belongs) and re-build the file by re-assembling the fragments in the right order, often impossible.<p>In a nutshell, if the volume was only made of contiguous files, they can be recovered 100% or very near 100%, only losing their filenames and their path in the &quot;previous&quot; filesystem structure.<p>BUT any file that was fragmented will either be lost completely or will need (in some cases only this is possible) manual reconstruction, something that may take days or weeks of work and very often with only very scarce or partial success.<p>The idea of a &quot;self-referencing&quot; archive with sector-level granularity is simply great, you won&#x27;t ever <i>need</i> it, but if you do, it could be a lifesaver.","time":1493544343,"type":"comment"},{"by":"simcop2387","id":14230332,"kids":[{"by":"dom0","id":14230736,"kids":[{"by":"simcop2387","id":14235968,"parent":14230736,"text":"In this case it&#x27;d be like losing the index of the tape, but still needing to recover data off it.","time":1493620602,"type":"comment"}],"parent":14230332,"text":"Tape storage normally uses either an index (linear FS or off-tape, e.g. for object storage) or a more-or-less recoverable stream format (&quot;tar&quot;).","time":1493543277,"type":"comment"}],"parent":14230159,"text":"Depends on the media.

One of the things I&#x27;ve come to appreciate after lots of travel and lots of &lt;insertcountry&gt;-Chinese food is how well developed and embedded American-Chinese food is as an <i>American</i> cuisine.<p>There&#x27;s rough variants of it in Western Europe when you can find it, but it&#x27;s a little different. But you can find an American-Chinese restaurant in almost every po-dunk country town across the entirety of America. I&#x27;ve been to places where the <i>only</i> places around to get prepared foods was a local gas station and a Chinese takeout. And the menu is both incredibly standardized, but quintessentially American.<p>P.F. Chang, Ka Pao, and a couple other of the new food places seem to be putting an effort to &quot;de-ethnic&quot; the food and make the preparation and presentation of it shift a bit more into familiar American diets.

They disappeared except for the Compartment Mode Workstations, which whittled down to maybe two, since neither paid market nor FOSS would compromise on legacy app breakage to reduce attacks or leaks. High-assurance security switched to creating deprivileged VM&#x27;s for UNIX&#x27;s on separation kernels with rigorous development, review, and testing. Some were even modifying the CPU&#x27;s themselves to try to encrypt or authenticate memory pages to spot breaks. This work wasn&#x27;t the first in OS security, the strongest in OS security then, or the strongest model today.<p>This author&#x27;s evangelism aside, it was a great supplement to a Linux box to reduce the risk in many ways. They did a lot of great, tactical mitigations that would certainly stop a decent chunk of exploits. Neater still is that they&#x27;re complementary to the prior work in high-security UNIX and attempts to automatically obfuscate systems for security. I recommend adding as many as possible long as it performs well.<p>&quot;Closing the public access doesn’t make PaX&#x2F;Grsecurity a non-free&#x2F;libre software. Those who purchase subscriptions can access the source code. &quot;<p>This is what I&#x27;m not getting. I&#x27;ve seen the claim in several places. Free&#x2F;libre software requires ability to read, modify, <i>and distribute</i> the code. It&#x27;s only free-as-in-speech software if I&#x27;m allowed to give it to the whole world for free. If it&#x27;s freely provided and no source distribution is allowed, then it&#x27;s free-as-in-beer. If it&#x27;s paid-source and no redistribution, then it&#x27;s proprietary software that comes with source. So-called shared source is a business model I encourage for companies that absolutely won&#x27;t do paid GPL or dual-licensed. Better than nothing if tool becomes popular or necessary. Plus, might let license of specific products or versions expire into FOSS license later.<p>In any case, it&#x27;s proprietary, shared-source software if I have to pay for the source and can&#x27;t redistribute it. So, could any HN readers who really know how their business model works confirm or reject that with data? What exactly do people buy with what rights? I keep hearing different things.<p>&quot;More importantly, PaX team&#x2F;Spender generously shared their work with the FLOSS world in the past 16 years.&quot;<p>This is very commendable on top of the security gains it provided. It&#x27;s why I&#x27;m questioning the claims instead of critiquing the team for going paid. I encourage it given companies will just freeload off you until the work is nearly unsustainable. One can always offer perpetual, free licenses to contributors, universities, non-profits, small businesses, and so on if feeling altruistic. Otherwise, they get what quality&#x2F;security they pay for.","time":1493508064,"type":"comment"}],"id":14229073,"score":3,"url":"https://hardenedlinux.github.io/announcement/2017/04/29/hardenedlinux-statement2.html","by":"viraptor"},"14229463":{"by":"nafizh","descendants":0,"id":14229463,"score":8,"time":1493510247,"title":"FAQ: The “SNAKE FIGHT” Portion of Your Thesis Defense","type":"story","url":"https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/faq-the-snake-fight-portion-of-your-thesis-defense"},"14229760":{"time":1493516631,"type":"story","descendants":13,"title":"EBay don't understand why people dodge their fees","kids":[{"by":"calbear81","id":14233761,"kids":[{"by":"jstanley","id":14233814,"kids":[{"by":"calbear81","id":14234780,"parent":14233814,"text":"The setup I normally use now if I know how much I want for an item is to do fixed price listing and not an auction and set it at an upper bound of what I would like to get but allow offers so it&#x27;s sort of like an auction.","time":1493599570,"type":"comment"}],"parent":14233761,"text":"Adding a buy it now price costs 50p upfront, whether it gets used or not, and the buy it now option disappears as soon as any bid is placed.<p>What you describe might work if I removed the auction component entirely.<p>Also note that the closest thing to a &quot;scam&quot; that I was subjected to was the on-platform non-paying bidder.

The app may be able to run offline, except that it will not show an icon, or will not run an asynchronously loaded script.<p>- A cache update may fail during re-populating the cache (e.g. computer powered off), and the next time the offline app is loaded, the cache stores a mixture of old and new assets.<p>3) There are several layers of caches between the pixels and the server assets (to name a few: CDNs, web proxies, browser&#x27;s disk cache, service worker&#x27;s cache).
