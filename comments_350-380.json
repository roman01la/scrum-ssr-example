Take the rest of the world&#x27;s rural poor as an example: small farmers organize into co-ops whose products are then sold on one or more markets (which depending on the market will be either horrible or great for them). I think in 20+ years when automated transportation starts to become a real thing, we&#x27;ll be able to more cheaply scale out small manufacturing jobs to rural people. Ideally this could again use a co-op model, but I haven&#x27;t seen many tech companies with that in mind.<p>Everything I have mentioned, btw, you could start with a private organization and then get government funding to cover a portion of your expenses.

Most sediments by volume come from erosion of the continents or other landmasses. There&#x27;s a much higher rate of deposition if you&#x27;re near a continent (e.g. river deltas).<p>Additionally, oceanic crust is always very young geologically.  It&#x27;s continually formed and destroyed (subducted). The ocean basins haven&#x27;t had much time to fill up with sediment, because oceanic crust is essentially a conveyor belt.<p>-----<p>So the short answer is: You&#x27;re depositing things very slowly on something that doesn&#x27;t have much time for sediments to build up.<p>-----<p>In a bit more detail, the sediments you get in the middle of the ocean are either the initial volcanic-related sediments that were deposited as the oceanic crust formed, or they&#x27;re limited to &quot;pelagic rain&quot; (things near the surface dying and very fine particles of clay) and some chemical sediments (things that precipitate directly out of water).<p>Not only that, but a lot of the things that die and sink will dissolve below about 2 Km water depth (see Carbonate Compensation Depth).<p>Therefore, deepwater depositional rates are very, very slow.<p>There&#x27;s a very important exception, though -- Carbonates.  If you start in shallow water (say, due to a small sliver of continental crust), organisms in the photosynthetic zone can produce huge amounts of carbonate sediments just from their shells (e.g. coral reefs).<p>Under the right conditions, carbonates can keep growing and keep pace with the subsiding crust.  A good example of this is the Bahamas.  You have several kilometers of sediment made of nothing but what grew there and died.  There are some very significant oil fields in these sorts of &quot;isolated platforms&quot;.<p>However, you need fairly unique conditions to get oil in the sort of isolate carbonate platforms that develop far away from land.  In most cases you&#x27;d find out in the ocean basins, you won&#x27;t have a source rock capable of generating hydrocarbons beneath the pile of sediments that the carbonates produce.  Instead, the source rock is conveniently sitting out there in the deep water where it&#x27;s not buried deep enough to produce oil.<p>There&#x27;s one other exception, and that&#x27;s when you&#x27;re near a volcano.  Volcanoes will happily produce lots of volcanic-related sediments.  However, volcaniclastic sediments almost never make good reservoirs (there are exceptions) or seals, so even if you did generate oil in a narrow band around a seamount, it would either leak out (no seal) or be trapped in something that you can&#x27;t get it out of (bad reservoir).<p>And there&#x27;s the longer answer :)","time":1493138107,"type":"comment"}],"parent":14193208,"text":"Great comment, thanks for the information.

Ever since &quot;Web 2.0&quot; was a thing, we&#x27;ve been trying to fit this round peg of delivering complex apps into the square hole of the web browser.  Sometimes, we do a decent job.

Everyone has their own good parts and pain points to be addressed, and all these tools were built with the best of intentions, to solve specific classes of tough problems, which may happen to be yours.  Look at the success and failure stories, and see who&#x27;s happy with their decisions about their tools, and which problems were solved with what framework.<p>3) For those people telling you &quot;just use vanilla JS&quot;, I&#x27;ll leave you this:\nAny sufficiently complicated vanilla JS program contains an ad-hoc, informally-specified, bug-ridden, slow implementation of half of Angular or React.","time":1493520195,"type":"comment"},{"by":"daleholborow","id":14218302,"parent":14218177,"text":"<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;aurelia.io&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;aurelia.io&#x2F;</a><p>I am a backend guy with some experience in Angular 1.5, Backbone etc, but currently dabbling in the front end again, and Aurelia looks pretty cool.

Angular is also a very nice framework of course, but it feels to me like it is still more something I would use to make webSITES in, instead of webAPPS (although I&#x27;m building a huge app in it right now), since it is not as &#x27;fast&#x27; and &#x27;snappy&#x27; to create components and an architecture as it is with React. (I&#x27;m talking development wise, not performance)<p>- On dependencies: I really dislike the entire dependency hell I always end up in when starting a JavaScript project. Since both JavaScript and TypeScript use NPM (at least, that&#x27;s the current de-facto standard), TypeScript does not solve this for you. \nFor instance: how do you manage your dependencies? NPM, Nuget or Yarn? What&#x27;s the difference, and do you have a day to look it all up?\nHow are you building your project and your .sass files? Gulp, Grunt, Webpack, NPM scripts, or just vanilla commandline?\nIf you&#x27;re creating a new class, how are you going import it in your consumer class? Declare all external JS files in your index.html? Or maybe you prefer CommonJS, RequireJS, UMD, SystemJS or ES2015(=ES6) native modules? And what if one dependency uses another system than you do?<p>- On languages:<p>TYPESCRIPT: it&#x27;s a very nice and powerful language, but like I said, it hooks into the standard JavaScript ecosystem. On top of the dependency hell, you&#x27;ll have to use a lot of JS interops (to be able to use existing JS libraries), which aren&#x27;t always that well maintained.<p>ES6: You could use the ES6 version of JavaScript. You&#x27;ll need Babel to transpile to ES5 JavaScript, so your code will run in all browsers. No problems with JS interops here, but dependency hell and ecosystem problems will stay.<p>GOOGLE DART: Also an amazing language, written by Google. You can discuss on what&#x27;s the better language (TypeScript or Dart), but the advantage here is the ecosystem. You build with Pub, you manage your dependencies with Pub, and there&#x27;s only one way of importing external classes. A lot of modern API&#x27;s you&#x27;ll need, like Futures (kind of like Promises), and Streams (like Observables) are built in the language itself, meaning they are maintained and tested by Google. I&#x27;ve been using AngularDart (a Dart-based Angular) for over 6 months now, and it&#x27;s going really well.<p>So for me, this results in:<p>- JavaScript ES6:\n  + Simple and fun language\n  + Close to old-skool JavaScript\n  - Too limited in OOP features\n  - Inconsistent and way too fast changing JavaScript ecosystem (dependency management, build tools, importing external libraries, ..)<p>- TypeScript:\n  + Very nice language\n  + Projects like Angular and React are written in it, so it&#x27;s easy to find tutorials in TypeScript\n  + Popular, and well documented\n  - Inconsistent and way too fast changing JavaScript ecosystem (dependency management, build tools, importing external libraries, ..)\n  - Had a lot of bullshit with JS interops (Both with finding good interops for JS libraries, as with creating interops myself)<p>- Google Dart:\n  + Very nice language (very close to Java and C#)\n  + AngularDart is fun to work with\n  + Very consistent eco-system\n  + Really well documented\n  + Good support from Google and community members on Gitter chat\n  + The most common API&#x27;s you&#x27;ll need are either included in the SDK, or written and maintained by Google themselves.\n  - Third-party libraries are not always that well documented\n  - The community is not (yet?) as big as the TS or JS community, so obviously it&#x27;s a little bit harder to find code examples etc<p>Conclusion:<p>- React is awesome, but being dependent on TypeScript (or ES6), you&#x27;ll spend lots and lots of time on managing your dependencies when your project grows even the slightest bit<p>- Google Dart is awesome, but AngularDart, although it&#x27;s a lovely piece of software, is still no React.<p>But for now I choose AngularDart. Perhaps in the future I&#x27;ll choose for React+TS again. But I&#x27;ll continue hoping for a real ReactDart. :)","time":1493383171,"type":"comment"},{"by":"loftsy","id":14218481,"parent":14218177,"text":"Dart is a sane language with great tooling.

It gives an excellent series of steps for tackling modern Javascript concepts one piece at a time: Javascript, React, ES6, and state management.<p>On that note, definitely don&#x27;t over-complicate the learning process by trying to learn many different things at once. Some people will say you should use a &quot;boilerplate&quot; to learn React, and they&#x27;re wrong - boilerplate projects almost always come with too many pieces configured, and are confusing for beginners.<p>Instead, the best advice is to focus on learning React itself first. Once you have a good understanding of how React works, you will better appreciate why a state management library like Redux can be useful, and you can learn about other tools later.<p>You should start out by reading through the official React docs and tutorial at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;facebook.github.io&#x2F;react&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;facebook.github.io&#x2F;react&#x2F;</a>, and I&#x27;d encourage you to use the official Create-React-App tool ( <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;facebookincubator&#x2F;create-react-app\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;facebookincubator&#x2F;create-react-app</a> ) for setting up projects. It creates a project with a solid build setup, with no configuration needed on your part. There&#x27;s an excellent post called &quot;Simple React Development in 2017&quot; ( <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hackernoon.com&#x2F;simple-react-development-in-2017-113bd563691f\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hackernoon.com&#x2F;simple-react-development-in-2017-113b...</a> ) that gives some more specific instructions on the actual steps to follow.<p>Past that, I keep a big list of links to high-quality tutorials and articles on React, Redux, and related topics, at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;markerikson&#x2F;react-redux-links\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;markerikson&#x2F;react-redux-links</a> . Specifically intended to be a great starting point for anyone trying to learn the ecosystem, as well as a solid source of good info on more advanced topics. It includes links for learning core Javascript (ES5), modern Javascript (ES6+), React, and much more. I also published an &quot;Intro to React (and Redux)&quot; presentation at <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.isquaredsoftware.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;02&#x2F;presentation-react-redux-intro&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.isquaredsoftware.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;02&#x2F;presentation-react-...</a> , which is a good overview of the basic concepts for both React and Redux.<p>Finally, the Reactiflux chat channels on Discord are a great place to hang out, ask questions, and learn.

Your hacker is probably stuck on something difficult. Don&#x27;t worry about it.<p>2.1: But it&#x27;s been two weeks since I saw anything!<p>Your hacker is working, alone probably, on a big project, and just started, right? She&#x27;s probably trying to figure it all out in advance. Ask her how it&#x27;s going; if she starts a lot of sentences, but interrupts them all with &quot;no, wait...&quot; or &quot;drat, that won&#x27;t work&quot;, it&#x27;s going well.<p>2.2: Isn&#x27;t this damaging to productivity?<p>No. Your hacker needs to recreate and think about things in many ways. He will be more productive with this recreation than without it. Your hacker enjoys working; don&#x27;t worry about things getting done reasonably well and quickly.<p>2.3: My hacker is constantly doing things unrelated to her job responsibilities.<p>Do they need to be done? Very few hackers can resist solving a problem when they can solve it, and no one else is solving it. For that matter, is your hacker getting her job done? If so, consider these other things a freebie or perk (for you). Although it may not be conventional, it&#x27;s probably helping out quite a bit.<p>2.4: My hacker is writing a book, reading USENET news, playing video games, talking with friends on the phone, and building sculptures out of paper clips. On company time!<p>He sounds happy. The chances are he&#x27;s in one of three states:<p>1. Basic job responsibilities are periodic (phone support, documentation, et al.) and there&#x27;s a lull in incoming work. Don&#x27;t worry about it!<p>2. Your hacker is stuck on a difficult problem.<p>3. Your hacker is bored silly and is trying to find amusement. Perhaps you should find him more challenging work?<p>Any of these factors may be involved. All of them may be involved. In general, if the work is challenging, and is getting done, don&#x27;t worry too much about the process. You might ask for your corporation to be given credit in the book.<p>2.5: But my other workers are offended by my hacker&#x27;s success, and it hurts their productivity.<p>Do you really need to have workers around who would rather be the person getting something done, than have it done already? Ego has very little place in the workplace. If they can&#x27;t do it well, assign them to something they can do.<p>① <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.seebs.net&#x2F;faqs&#x2F;hacker.html#section-2\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.seebs.net&#x2F;faqs&#x2F;hacker.html#section-2</a>","time":1493387622,"type":"comment"},{"by":"discomulatora","id":14218676,"parent":14217849,"text":"Usually depends on the contract of work.

I would also ask a few questions:<p>1) Is the employee using company resources to work on their project?  If so... it&#x27;s bad for them and probably means the company owns it.  If the company owns it, is the company getting a say in what&#x27;s being built &#x2F; is in line with the company goals?<p>2) Did the employee ever lie about doing their personal work at work?  If so, I would suggest firing them for not being honest.  If the employee is logging 8 hours, but only working 5... yes, that&#x27;s dishonest.  Are they billing clients for the extra time?<p>3) Did the employee flaunt, boast, or brag to others that they were doing personal work at work?  If so, I would suggest firing them for being a disruption.<p>In reality, how I think this should play out is less black and white.<p>If the employee is getting his work done and still has time to do side projects, and I liked the quality of his work, like the employee, etc... I&#x27;d want to offer him a raise to do more work at work... give him more responsibilities that take up more of his time.  If his current workload only takes 80% of his time, I want to find a way to give him a 20% raise and 20% more work.  I know the first response to the question in the link said that management didn&#x27;t like giving raises... but I disagree.  If he was idle and had more time, and I could give him more work, I&#x27;d want to -- and pay him for it.<p>If that wasn&#x27;t an option... if the employee was just killing time between builds working on his own stuff... as long as nobody was waiting on him, I&#x27;d suggest he use his own laptop, at least, and that we make sure his employment contract allows him to own work done using the company tools and internet.  Assuming I don&#x27;t know what he&#x27;s working on, I&#x27;d want to know a bit about the project -- it could be based on something we make and that may be a conflict of interest, or be the next great Child Porn Bit Torrent Network, or a blatant rip off of copyrighted materials.  I want the company shielded from liability there -- which means making sure he owns 100% of what he&#x27;s working on.  Likely we can&#x27;t ever be shielded from potential lawsuit if we provided resources towards the project... even internet access... so I&#x27;d want to make sure there were clear lines and plausible deniability.  &quot;He used his own laptop, cell phone hotspot, etc.&quot;<p>If the employee lied about doing the work on company time... if they ever billed me, or a client, for hours spent on their personal project... I think that&#x27;s a serious problem.  I would have to fire them in that case.  If they are reporting working 8 hours, but only worked 5, that&#x27;s throwing off my KPIs and team metrics.  If they are charging clients for more time than they worked... yeah I can&#x27;t have that -- it puts my credibility in jeopardy.  I&#x27;d have to let them go.<p>Lastly I&#x27;d encourage the employee to keep his mouth shut.  Loose lips sink ships... and while the company has to give the appearance of treating everyone the same, I probably don&#x27;t want this sort of thing to be the norm among engineers... creates too much incentive for false estimates, for starters.  So we can have a deal where he does what he wants when his work is done, but he needs to keep it to himself.  No asking the QA guys to test his project, no asking other devs how to solve personal project problems, no asking the graphic designers for logos, etc.  If he does this work at work, he needs to not advertise that he is doing it or distract other people from their jobs...","time":1493387137,"type":"comment"},{"by":"r3dey3","id":14218790,"parent":14217849,"text":"Is he&#x2F;she using company resources?

This is like writing an O&#x27;Reilly book entitled &quot;Essential System Administration In Client-Side Javascript&quot; detailing a cookbook of the most common techniques you would want to use to do local system administration from Angular, React, Meteor&#x2F;Ember, etc, with special attention to the pitfalls of identifying whether the local system is a Windows,Mac, Linux, a mobile browser, tablet, etc, and listing the various ways you can set up the local user&#x27;s device to your own liking.<p>Where it crosses the line is if it&#x27;s written in a highly informative way without any indication WHATSOEVER of being satire.  Local system administration from javascript frameworks doesn&#x27;t exist.  It&#x27;s not a thing.  You couldn&#x27;t so much as set the time.<p>But when you write with authority on how to do that and more, suddenly it does exist.  What&#x27;s more, it will be interesting and useful.  If you write with authority and an overview of the subject, in the way done here (it starts by identifying the scope of the issue - the very first words of the abstract are &quot;Uromycitisis is a rare but serious condition that affects over 2,000 mostly adult men and women in the United States each year&quot;.  From the moment you&#x27;ve written those words -- you even say who it affects and the exceptions, since it affects adults but mostly adults -- you are now an expert and you&#x27;re not writing a satire or hoax: you&#x27;re writing fraud.<p>It would be as if I began the above with:<p>&quot;Web-based administration of local devices with a standard browser serving as the remote administration client is a small but growing choice of hundreds of large companies with 5,000-50,000+ employees.  Its advantages include leveraging development practices that may already be familiar, web standards, regular security upgrades from the major browsers, centralized distribution of small updates while leveraging the security mechanisms (such as HTTPS and signed certificates) already present in the browser, and cross-platform availability across many devices.  Simply put, System Administration in client-side javascript is the closest you can come to fully controlling your user&#x27;s devices without administrative tools at all.  While it has important limitations, such as being unable to repartition hard-drives or install a standard image while the operating system is running, in other respects it enables all of the power of many administrative tools without many of the downsides.  In this book we will cover some of the basic functions you may want to do, such as applying security updates, installing or removing software, creating user accounts and setting their privileges, and, in the case of Windows computers, setting up roaming profiles.  Let&#x27;s get started.&quot;<p>Is that a hoax?  No, it&#x27;s more like simple fraud.  (Our author invented a research institution, created fake gmail accounts, etc.)<p>Sorry.  I don&#x27;t support the author in how they went about this.  It would be different if what I wrote was <i>hilarious</i> - such as bemoaning that for the moment Apple Watches unfortunately do not support a standard browser, so you will have to break into them by finding and applying zero days for the iPhone, which are unfortunately patched regularly; a list of Russian and Chinese sources is contained in Appendix 1, and you can usually ask for a sample while promising bitcoins - but is the above paragraph I wrote hilarious?  No.  It&#x27;s not hilarious and that means it&#x27;s not okay.<p>[1] direct link to PDF: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.the-scientist.com&#x2F;images&#x2F;Opinion&#x2F;2017&#x2F;UNOAJ-04-00132.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.the-scientist.com&#x2F;images&#x2F;Opinion&#x2F;2017&#x2F;UNOAJ-04-00...</a>","time":1493054575,"type":"comment"},{"by":"jszymborski","id":14185187,"kids":[{"by":"woliveirajr","id":14185773,"kids":[{"by":"jszymborski","id":14186380,"parent":14185773,"text":"The peer-review system, as very flawed as it is, protects us from a certain level of bad and in some cases fake science.<p>It&#x27;s not very difficult to establish a peer-review ring when you use freely available emails, and journals are increasingly aware of this [0,1].

You sacrife your free time and maybe even health or friendships. You start to feel bad for every day you don&#x27;t work on your product, as you know it all depends on you, and maybe a couple of co-founders. You know your product is great and it could make many customers happy. Yet what you earn from your it is peanuts and you don&#x27;t see how this will change any time soon.<p>In that scenario, venture capital or a buy-out seem like a very appealing idea. After all, if you&#x27;ve come this far, it means that your product means a lot to you and you have more ideas than time. And suddenly knowing that you could get a decent amount of money to quit your &quot;boring&quot; daily job and make all these ideas come true gets even more interesting.<p>That burning desire to make your &quot;baby&quot; succeed should not be underestimated. That&#x27;s why so many startups try hard to get a decent funding. I can&#x27;t blame them, because I&#x27;ve been there. Heck, if a &quot;big player&quot; came to my little startup and offered a good deal, I would probably more than consider taking it. In the end, life is short and you can only build so many valuable things in your life that might have an impact and make a difference.<p>Still, I&#x27;m happy to have a fully bootstrapped startup that is not yet bringing enough money to quit my job. It is tough, it takes a lot of patience, and even more sacrifice every day. But also the prospect of making it profitable enough to have a small team that can work on your idea has a special kind of appeal. Not wanting to be the next Google or Facebook is a good thing in my opinion, but I understand that there is a lot of people who just burn with desire to push their ideas forward faster.

Unless their pay is cut to compensate, their per-hour rate is going to go up in this change. And it&#x27;s worth repeating, they don&#x27;t have any benefits now so aren&#x27;t losing them.<p>* Employment status also brings unemployment coverage and disability benefits in case they get fired or become disabled.<p>Side note:<p>I hope for Leapforce&#x27;s sake and that of their contractors&#x2F;employees that they got Google&#x27;s blessing before making their CEO so available and transparent on the relationship with Google.
